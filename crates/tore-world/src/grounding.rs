//! Grounding: every object stands on the bottom of its shape
//! (docs/formats/objects-and-shapes.md, "Grounding").
//!
//! **The rule.** Every ground object, surface unit, man, wreck, ruin and
//! parked aircraft stands with the lowest point of its drawn shape (faces, lines and
//! sprites, at the scale it is drawn) on the ground: [`lift_ft`] is how far
//! its origin stands above the ground for that. Only three kinds keep their
//! authored rule ([`Footing`]): runways and pavement stand on their pavement
//! plane, bridges and roads on the map's height at their origin, and ships
//! on their waterline (their origin). A presentation scale-up (the far-man
//! boost) scales from the feet, never from the origin ([`scaled_origin`]).
//!
//! Every path that places or draws something on the ground goes through this
//! module: the layout and ground target placements (`terrain::Placements::
//! stance_on_terrain`, which also sets the contact, collision and hit box), moving
//! units, wrecks, ruins, the men's sprites, parked aircraft. Never ground an
//! object any other way: before this module each path did its own grounding
//! (faces only, sprites skipped, men exempt, the boost about the centre) and
//! the same bug came back each time a new path or a new kind of shape
//! appeared. `tore-app --surface-dump --grounding` audits every type of the
//! import against it.
//!
//! Provenance: fitted (B13, 2026-10-12, extended by slice GROUND,
//! 2026-10-13): the lowest point agrees with the shape's F2 ground offset,
//! the word FA 0x42e0c0 reads to stand an object on the ground, within 3 ft
//! for every placed type of the retail data.
