//! The equivalence scenarios of docs/formats/checkpoint.md: missions built
//! from synthetic fixtures, each with the inputs and fixture adjustments of
//! every tick, the tick N to checkpoint at, the M ticks to step on, and what
//! the world must hold at tick N.
//!
//! Stage H0 built the first three (the single-player tick mission, the crowd
//! fixture's fight and an open mission with handoffs). Slice H8 added the
//! rest and the state each scenario asserts at tick N (`expect`), so the
//! whole-world test is known to exercise the state it is meant to: a
//! restore that drops a field nothing reads would otherwise pass. Every
//! scenario is built from synthetic fixtures; none reads retail data. The
//! lobby pass's slice R1 added the AI respawns, with one pending at N, and
//! slice R2 a lead held for a lost human, given back after N.
