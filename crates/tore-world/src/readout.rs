//! The cockpit readout: everything a seat's displays and cockpit sounds show
//! that comes from its ownship, its sensors, its threat service, the AI or the
//! mission, as plain data. D5b of the multiplayer plan; see
//! docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "The flight screen draws a frame".
//!
//! The host computes it from the simulation ([`World::cockpit_readout`]) and a
//! launcher, the plane's position, attitude, speed and devices as the caller
//! presents them: single player builds it every rendered frame from the
//! interpolated flight, a server builds it at each snapshot from the tick's
//! flight, and a client takes the newest one from a snapshot. The displays read
//! this and never the ownship, so they draw the same from either source.
//!
//! It holds no references into combat. Its groups match the wire's
//! ([`docs/formats/net-protocol.md`](../../../docs/formats/net-protocol.md)):
//! each can be coded as changed or unchanged against a baseline. Every list is
//! bounded by a limit below; a longer one keeps the entries nearest the plane.
//! Contacts carry world positions, so a client draws them around its own
//! predicted aircraft. Static loadout and mission data (the weapon records,
//! the airport scene, the roster's sides and names) are not in it.
