//! M1e AI-6: the live hookup between `tore_sim::ai` and the running mission.
//!
//! This module is a bridge and nothing else. Every decision, every store debit
//! and every motion belongs to [`tore_sim::ai::mission`]; everything here only
//! moves data between that mission and the host's existing combat world:
//!
//! - one [`WorldObject`] snapshot per tick, built from the player's
//!   authoritative [`flight::State`] plus each AI actor's own flight state,
//! - each actor's pose mirrored into the matching `live::Target` so the
//!   existing renderer, sensors, missile collision and damage keep working off
//!   one world,
//! - damage mirrored back so a dead target kills its actor,
//! - each [`LaunchEvent`] realised as a real `live::Projectile` flown by the
//!   existing missile code, never by a second physics path,
//! - each missile turned into a [`ThreatReport`] delivered only to the aircraft
//!   it is aimed at (B47: no broadcast).
//!
//! The creator uses this bridge by default. `--fixture-wings` keeps the old
//! straight-flight launch and integration; ordinary free flight has no bridge.
//!
//! Projectiles carry actor-owned weapon and fire-control observations into
//! the shared seeker lifecycle. AI defense receives the same bounded missile
//! information service as the player RWR. Compatibility steering remains an
//! explicit weapon-rules option.
