//! Surface units fighting: each tick every armed unit and SAM battery runs
//! its engagement controller ([`tore_sim::ai::surface`]) against the hostile
//! aircraft, and the hostile ground units and ships, it can see, and the
//! shots it asks for become projectiles through `live::State::fire_surface`
//! (docs/spec/surface-defenses.md, "Surface AI", "SAM batteries", "AAA and
//! flak", "Surface against surface").
//!
//! [`Arsenal`] is what a unit fights with, read once from its NT and JT
//! records when the terrain builds (the AAA tuning table applied to its
//! guns); [`step`] is the tick. The changing state (controllers, magazines,
//! rails, radars) lives in [`super::SurfaceState`], which combat checkpoints.
//! The radar half (who emits, radar on and off, HARM shutdown, the RWR lock
//! feed) is [`super::emitters`].
//!
//! Fitted rules here (agent decisions, 2026-10-10, recorded in the spec):
//!
//! - A gun mount has its own controller and magazine (a ship's fore and aft
//!   CIWS turn and fire on their own); a unit's missile mounts of one record
//!   share one controller, and each salvo round leaves from a loaded rail
//!   whose arc covers the target.
//! - Rounds leave from the mount: the unit's pose this tick (a moving unit
//!   fires from where it is) plus the hardpoint offset at real size
//!   ([`super::mount_position_ft`]) turned by the unit's attitude, at least
//!   [`MUZZLE_CLEARANCE_FT`] above the terrain. Radars and sights look from
//!   [`EYE_HEIGHT_FT`] above the unit's reference point. Nothing depends on
//!   the shape's extents.
//! - A mount arc of 0 on an axis is unrestricted (every land vehicle reads 0
//!   for heading); otherwise the target's bearing (guns: and elevation) must
//!   lie within the half-arc of the mount's rest direction, relative to the
//!   hull. A missile's launch pitch is the line to the target clamped between
//!   10 degrees and the rail's arc.
//! - Line of sight samples the terrain every 500 ft (at most 64 samples).
//! - A gun's round ends a little past the target ([`gun_end_range`]); a flak
//!   shell's time fuze is its time of flight to the lead point.
//! - The barrage zone fires each burst with its record's random-fire chance,
//!   at the nearest hostile's lead point clamped into its fire zone and
//!   scattered by the record's offset-fire angles.
//!
//! Surface against surface (John, 2026-10-11: "If units are in range of
//! opposing sides they should shoot at each other"):
//!
//! - A weapon aims at what its record's target flags allow (retail): the air
//!   flag for aircraft, the surface flag for ground units and ships
//!   ([`WeaponArms::aims_at_aircraft`], [`WeaponArms::aims_at_surface`]). So
//!   tank, armoured car and small-arms guns fight both, flak and SAMs stay
//!   anti-aircraft, the SS-N-9 fights ships (agent decision: it is
//!   anti-ship), and a land AAA gun, whose record has only the air flag, may
//!   also fire at the ground after any aircraft (John, 2026-10-11: "If it can
//!   shoot at ground targets let it"; [`WeaponArms::ground_fire`]).
//! - What it may aim at is a unit of the other side that the scene holds:
//!   a ground vehicle, a site, a truck, a radar or a ship, never a building,
//!   a parked aircraft or the invisible barrage zone ([`surface_contacts`]).
//!   The template's `react` masks (ATTACK and DEFEND per class) do not gate
//!   it: John's rule is that units in range shoot (opinionated, John).
//! - Preference: an air-defence unit (a SAM or AAA class word) engages
//!   aircraft first, every other unit ground units and ships first. A
//!   controller sees only the eligible contacts of the preferred kind while
//!   there is one, nearest first, ties by id, so the choice is a function of
//!   the positions alone (agent decision).
//! - A gun aims at a surface target with a quarter of its air aim error
//!   ([`tore_sim::ai::surface::surface_aim_error_deg`], fitted). Missile
//!   locks and painting feed aircraft only: a ground unit has no RWR.
//! - A squad's small arms aim at an aircraft with four times the visual guns'
//!   error ([`tore_sim::ai::surface::small_arms_aim_error_deg`], fitted,
//!   agent, 2026-10-12) and lead it by 30 percent of its speed
//!   ([`observation`], [`tore_sim::ai::surface::SMALL_ARMS_LEAD`], fitted,
//!   agent, 2026-10-12): riflemen have no sight on a jet, and a squad rarely
//!   hits a fast one.
