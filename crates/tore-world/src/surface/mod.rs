//! Surface units: the ships, SAM sites, AAA guns, vehicles, men and buildings
//! that stand on the ground or sea of a mission, as resolved from the theater
//! layout and, with a Quick Mission ground target, from its retail template.
//! Behaviour and numbers: docs/spec/surface-defenses.md; record layouts:
//! docs/formats/surface-units.md and docs/formats/quick-templates.md.
//!
//! [`Surface`] is the resolved, immutable picture every machine builds alike
//! from the same mission text and the same retail data: one [`Unit`] per
//! surface object with its fixed id ([`UnitId`]), owner, side, type and
//! destroyed look, plus the parked aircraft, supply trucks and batteries
//! later slices place. [`Surface::digest`] fingerprints it so two machines
//! can prove they built the same one. The terrain holds it
//! ([`crate::terrain::Terrain::surface`]) and builds its scene from it;
//! combat registers each unit as a target with its side, and keeps the
//! units' changing state ([`SurfaceUnitState`]) in its checkpointed state.
//!
//! This module resolves and identifies; [`movement`] moves the units that
//! follow a route. Nothing here fires.
