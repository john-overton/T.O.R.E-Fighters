//! The master server's protocol: what a game, a dedicated server and the
//! Internet Lobby say to `tore-master`, and what it says back.
//!
//! The master keeps the list of listed games, answers the Internet Lobby,
//! measures how a router maps the game port, introduces a joining player to
//! a host and relays the traffic of a pair that cannot reach each other. Its
//! wire is its own, separate from the game's transport: every packet is
//! checked under the id `TORE-MASTER` and carries the master protocol's
//! version ([`MASTER_VERSION`]), so a game's transport never mistakes one for
//! its own. The format is
//! [`docs/formats/master-protocol.md`](../../../../docs/formats/master-protocol.md);
//! how the pieces fit is the architecture guide's "Master server and
//! connectivity".
//!
//! This module holds the wire (slice I1): every packet's encoder and bounded
//! decoder ([`packet`]), the common fields ([`candidate`]), the constants
//! both ends share, and the cookie key the master proves addresses with
//! ([`CookieKey`]). Like the transport, nothing here reads a clock or
//! touches a socket.
//!
//! ```
//! use tore_net::master::{Challenge, MasterPacket};
//!
//! let challenge = MasterPacket::Challenge(Challenge { nonce: 7, cookie: 42 });
//! let bytes = challenge.encode().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(bytes.len(), 23);
//! assert_eq!(MasterPacket::decode(&bytes).unwrap(), challenge);
//! ```
