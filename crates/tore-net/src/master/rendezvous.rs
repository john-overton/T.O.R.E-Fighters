//! A host's conversation with the master (slice I3): listing a game from its
//! game port ("Listing a game" in the architecture guide and the master
//! protocol).
//!
//! [`Rendezvous`] is a state machine like the transport's: it never reads a
//! clock or touches a socket. The host's loop reads its socket through
//! [`Rendezvous::over`], which takes the master's datagrams out of the game
//! port's stream ([`Routed`]), calls [`Rendezvous::update`] for its timers
//! and sends what [`Rendezvous::transmit`] gives on the same socket, so the
//! master sees the outside address of the very socket players join.
//! [`HostListing`] adds what needs the real world: the lookup of the
//! master's name on a thread, and the host's own addresses.
//!
//! What it does, with the master protocol's numbers:
//!
//! 1. With the master's address known it sends the mapping test's two
//!    Probes and a Register, at the same moment (*agent decision:* the
//!    listing does not wait for the test, whose result only the Report uses
//!    in stage I). A Challenge is answered with the Register again, carrying
//!    the cookie; Listed makes the game listed.
//! 2. A Heartbeat with the summary every heartbeat interval (30 seconds, or
//!    what Listed says), and one more when the summary changes, at most one
//!    every 5 seconds; a Keep when nothing else has gone out for the keep
//!    interval (15 seconds). No two of them closer than 2 seconds, the
//!    master's limit per listing (agent decision).
//! 3. An Unknown listing means register again at once: a restarted master
//!    lists the game again within one exchange.
//! 4. A request (Register or Heartbeat) unanswered is sent again every 3
//!    seconds (agent decision); no answer at all for 10 seconds means the
//!    master is silent, and the request is then repeated after 2, 4, 8 and
//!    up to 60 seconds, the next of the master's addresses each time.
//! 5. Unlisting, or stopping, sends Unregister three times at once (*agent
//!    decision:* at once, since the socket may close right after).
//!
//! 6. A Meet (slice J2) is answered with punches to the player's addresses
//!    from the game port and a Meet ack ([`meet`](super::meet)).
//! 7. A Relay open (slice J3) is acknowledged with the listing's token, and
//!    the channel's frames reach the transport as datagrams from its relayed
//!    address ([`relay`](super::relay)); the master's Relay close, or no
//!    frame for a minute, closes it here.
//! 8. A listing follows a migrated mission (stage K, slice K8): the host
//!    exports its [`ListingPart`] (the master, the listing's id and token,
//!    the relay channels and their keys) for its standbys, the game that
//!    takes over resumes from it ([`Rendezvous::resume`]) and heartbeats
//!    with the token from its own port, which moves the listing and its
//!    channels there, and an old host that learns another hosts now lets
//!    the listing go without a word ([`Rendezvous::release`]).
//!
//! The summary is the host's discovery answer without its nonce. The host's
//! loop offers it through [`Rendezvous::wants_summary`] and
//! [`Rendezvous::set_summary`], which the rendezvous asks for at most once a
//! second (agent decision), so building it costs nothing on most turns.
