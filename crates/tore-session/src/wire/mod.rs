//! The game's wire messages: the sections a Payload carries (Inputs,
//! Snapshot, Events, Own state) and the reliable message bodies, with the
//! bookkeeping each end keeps per connection.
//!
//! The specification is [`docs/formats/net-protocol.md`](../../../../docs/formats/net-protocol.md)
//! from "Inputs" on; where the build settled a detail the design left open,
//! that document says so. Everything here is plain data and pure functions of
//! it: no clock, socket or `World` step.
//!
//! - [`inputs`]: the Inputs section, the controls' quantization and the
//!   numbered commands.
//! - [`entity`]: the entities a snapshot carries, their quantized states and
//!   their records against a baseline.
//! - [`snapshot`]: the Snapshot section, its header, and the per-connection
//!   baselines: [`snapshot::EntitySender`] on the host and
//!   [`snapshot::EntityReceiver`] on the client.
//! - [`priority`]: the relevance bands and the priority accumulator.
//! - [`readout`]: the cockpit readout inside a snapshot, against the one
//!   the client acknowledged.
//! - [`space`]: how a snapshot packet's 1,200 bytes are shared.
//! - [`events`]: the Events section, the host's queue and the client's
//!   receiver.
//! - [`names`]: the name table the Names message fills.
//! - [`own_state`]: the Own state section, the exact state of the player's
//!   plane against an acknowledged one.
//! - [`messages`]: the reliable message bodies.
//! - [`migration`]: stage K's message bodies, host migration and rejoin.
//! - [`connection`]: the host's and the client's per-connection wire state,
//!   which tie the parts above to the transport's packet numbers.
//! - [`from_world`]: filling the wire's plain data from `tore-world`'s.
//!
//! Every decoder is bounded: it checks each count and length against the
//! protocol's limits before reading on, and returns a [`WireError`] for any
//! bytes, never panicking.

/// and Battle net command the golden now lists, 16 since the baseline field
/// of the readout and the entity records is 7 bits, a window of 127

/// setting 12's 50 to 150 nautical miles and setting 23, AI respawn, in the
/// lobby state's list (slice W0), 21 since the AC-130 gunsight: the Inputs
/// frame's sight slew and zoom step, the sight commands 28 and 29, the
/// readout's Gunsight group (sight, look, aim point, pipper impacts, per-gun
/// readiness with TERRAIN MASK, notice and zoom) and the standby stream's
/// sight (gunsight slice S4), 22 since the surface round (slice N1): the
/// fifth entity kind, a moving surface unit, with the kind's code widened
/// to 3 bits in the Inputs section's view subject; the Surface burst,
/// Surface burst end and Surface unit events (codes 18 to 20); the surface
/// digest in the Seated message and the Resumed flight; the debrief pilot's

/// The ground target's text lines (`ground-target`, `defenses`,
/// `surface-seed`, `enemy-nationality`, `start ground auto`) travel in the
/// mission text, which the mission hash covers. 23 since the air-to-ground
/// round (slice NA): the readout's Sight, Sight sensor, Laser, Bomb sight,
/// Guided, HARM cue and Weapons in flight groups (scalar groups 15 to 21),
/// the ground pages' flags at the end of the Sensors group and the ground
/// page's contacts (list 16); the extended combat commands after code 31

/// (`ToggleAirGround`), the HARM channel (code 3) and readiness codes 25
/// (`NoEmitter`) and 26 (`TrackLost`), which the round's slices added under
/// 22, are part of 23's definition; a loadout row may name a laser
/// designator pod's SEE record. 24 since the mp-fixes round (slice FX-A):
/// every game builds the redrawn airports (docs/formats/redrawn-airports.md),
/// so the airfields' buildings, their added hangars and vehicles (new target
/// ids), the parked aircraft and the AI's airfield points differ from a 23
/// game's; no byte layout changed for it. Folded under 24: the extended
/// combat commands 3 (`GunKeyDown`) and 4 (`GunKeyUp`) after code 31 (slice
/// FX-T) and the readout's Guided sight group's level T, 15 to 18 values
/// (slice FX-H). 25 since the surface close-out (slice CL-CF): every game
/// builds the city fill (`tore_world::city`), whose buildings aircraft
/// crash into and ground bursts knock flat, which a 24 game lacks. Folded
/// under 25: the mission text's `enemy-start` line (slice CL-R), which a 24
/// game refuses; `ground_trim` in the AI airfield sequence's checkpoint
/// (slice CL-AP); the front line in the surface digest (slice CL-FL); and
/// the City flattened event (code 21) with the world checkpoint's city fill
/// section (section 12), which carry the buildings ground bursts knocked
/// flat (review fixes). 26 since the bug-fix round's slice BF: the Effect
/// event (code 11) carries the size it is drawn at, percent of its
/// explosion type's (`tore_sim::combat::blast_scale`), as a one-bit flag and
/// a byte when it is not 100, which a 25 game cannot read.
/// 27 since the stores slice (BP3): the Stores event (code 22), every
/// aircraft's drawn stations and the whole stores on each, sent when they
/// change and at a seat, so a client draws every aircraft's pylons and
/// stores (docs/spec/stores-on-pylons.md).
/// 28 since the networking slice NET2: the transport's Keepalive carries a
/// flags byte, and a host sends it marked loading to every player while it
/// builds a mission, so its players keep the connection and its standbys
/// hold off a migration through a long build.
/// 29 since the AC-130 sensor console (slice nr-orbit): seat command 28
/// (SensorConsole), and the exact own-plane state's autopilot carries the
/// orbit hold (mode Orbit 4 and its plan and memory).
/// 30 since the sensor console's search and keys (slice nr-cona): seat
/// command 29 (Console, a sub-code and a value), and the orbit in the exact
/// own-plane state carries `pinned`, `heading` and `altitude`.
/// 31 since the gun lock and the centre's pause (slice nr-cona follow-up):
/// Console sub-code 5 (GunLock), the orbit's `still_s` in the exact
/// own-plane state, and the gun lock in the readout's gunsight group.
/// 32 since the airport merge (slice nr-apmerge): no message changes, but
/// the shared world differs (84 paired theater airfields are single fields
/// with new runways and ids aliased), so an older game must not join.
/// 33 since the missile identities pass (slice nr-fox2): no message
/// changes, but the store catalog (new R-27 variants, corrected names and
/// carrier rules), IR seeker response and radio cooldown keys differ, so an
/// older game must not join.
/// 34 since the player release pass (slice nr-fox3): no message changes,
/// but player missile release outcomes (advisory MAX RANGE and lock, active
/// maddog, SARH support recovery) differ, so an older game must not join.
/// 35 since the F-15/F-16 stations pass (slice nr-f15): no message changes,
/// but the F-15C, F-16C and Mi-24 store stations (release positions) moved,
/// so an older game must not join.
/// 36 since the wingman loadouts pass (slice nr-wingload): no message
/// changes, but AI wingmen take their human lead's loadout (more
/// FlightLoadouts entries, mission text `share-flight-loadout`), so an
/// older game must not join.
/// 37 since jettison (slice nr-jett): the extended live command 5
/// (JettisonTanks), tank quantities in store stations 55 to 63, the
/// sound-only jettison blast and inert falling bodies, so an older game must
/// not join.
/// 38 since the bomb flight model (slice nr-bombphys): bombs carry their
/// body (mass, drag, retarder, steering) and fly one shared fitted model, and
/// sights read it, so an older game must not join.
/// 39 since the small guided bombs (slice nr-bombs2): GBU-12, GBU-16 and
/// GBU-38 join the store catalog, so an older game must not join.
/// 40 since the AC-130 damage pass (slice nr-nightfx): the 40 mm and 105 mm
/// shells do twice the damage, so an older game must not join.
/// 41 since the contact bounds fix (slice nr-mav): thin line geometry no
/// longer inflates surface objects' solid contact boxes, so an older game
/// must not join.
/// 42 since the cleanup round (slices nr-ac105, nr-aijett, nr-fx2,
/// nr-sndfix): the 105 mm splash and AI jettison change the shared
/// simulation, so an older game must not join.
/// 43 since the extra stations (slice nr-stations): F-15C centreline and
/// wing tank rows, the F-16C inner wet pair and two tank records, so an
/// older game must not join.
/// 44 since the second stations pass (slice nr-stations2): F-15C centreline
/// bomb rack, F-22 wing stations, MiG-29 and Rafale centreline tanks and
/// three tank records, so an older game must not join.
/// 45 since the ordnance page pass (slice nr-ordui): the Pave Knife is no
/// longer a weapon item and a loadout naming it loads the Pave Spike, so an
/// older game must not join.
/// 46 since the store signature (slice nr-rcs): external stores raise the
/// radar signature every radar and seeker reads, so an older game must not
/// join.
/// 47 since the F-16C wingtip AIM-120 (slice nr-f16tip): an older game
/// refuses the load, so an older game must not join.
/// 48 since Player Choice and AI off (slice nr-mpchoice): the ai setting,
/// Choice slots, aircraft in loadouts and revivals, and the despawn and
/// replacement commands, so an older game must not join.
/// 49 since the collision credit fix (slice nr-collkill): splash on a
/// bystander no longer makes its shooter the last attacker, which changes
/// kill credit and the combat checkpoint, so an older game must not join.
/// 50 since the F-4B gun pod option (slice nr-f4gun): the F-4B's centreline
/// row takes one SUU-16, which an older game refuses, and the `Stores` event
/// lists a hung gun pod as one store, so an older game must not join.
/// 51 since the Stores station index (slice nr-basefix): a Stores event's
/// station index is 7 bits and can name tank hardpoint 9 (code 64, the
/// F-16C inner wet pair and the Rafale centreline), so an older game must
/// not join.
/// 52 since min-players and the King's force start (slices nr-minplayers, nr-lobbyui): the lobby settings list gains min-players, and the Lobby message gains the force-start seconds, so an older game must not join.
/// 63 since shared ground-pad foundations change terrain contact and placement.
/// 64 since F-22N bay/wing carriage, magazine release origins and bay-only trigger gating.
/// 71 adds human visual designation and its checkpoint retention state.
