//! A host's mission builds with its players kept (protocol 28, slice NET2).
//!
//! A host builds a mission's world on its own loop: when the King changes
//! the mission or a setting that rebuilds it, when a flight with the
//! players' loadouts starts, and for the next mission after an end. The
//! loop sends nothing meanwhile. Before protocol 28 a build over 5 seconds
//! dropped every player for silence, and one over 1.5 seconds set the
//! standbys racing to take the game over.
//!
//! Now the build stays on the loop (John, 2026-10-13: keepalives during the
//! build, not a worker thread) and a [`tore_net::Loading`] thread speaks for
//! the host while it runs: each player's loading Keepalive, a quarter second
//! into the build and then twice a second, for up to 3 minutes. A player
//! hearing it keeps the connection and counts the host lost only after
//! [`crate::standby::takeover::LOADING_SILENCE`] instead of 1.5 seconds.
//!
//! The program that runs the host hands it a way to clone its socket
//! ([`Host::set_loading_socket`]): the dedicated server, a game that hosts
//! (its socket and the in-process link's send-only copy) and `tore-bot`.
//! A relayed player is reached through the relay channels the program last
//! gave ([`Host::set_relay_channels`]). A host given none (the tests' hosts)
//! builds as before.
