//! Taking over and resuming (stage K; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Losing the
//! host"), built by slice K4.
//!
//! **The new host.** [`Host::resume`] builds a host from a standby's
//! [`Takeover`]: the world at T (the tick the next step runs), the session's
//! state parts and each seat's last recorded input. Every player of the
//! players part is **absent** until its game connects again with its rejoin
//! token and resumes:
//!
//! - **Resume** (message 48) is answered with **Resumed** (49): a seated
//!   player gets a new flight, its seat and plane, the tick its plane stands
//!   at, the number of the last command the old host applied for it and its
//!   plane's exact state there; anyone else is told it is not flying (and
//!   gets the Mission again when its number or text differs).
//! - **Backlog** (50) brings a seated player's inputs from that tick on, and
//!   the commands not yet applied, numbered afresh.
//! - **The resume window.** The clock holds at T until every seated player
//!   has resumed and sent its backlog, at most [`RESUME_WINDOW`].
//! - **The fast-forward.** Then the host steps from T to the **present**,
//!   where the old host's clock would be now ([`Present`]), at most
//!   [`FAST_FORWARD_TICKS`] an update, sending no snapshot meanwhile: each
//!   resumed seat on its backlog, each absent one on its last recorded
//!   controls and then neutral by the stall rule. At the present it goes
//!   **live** and keeps the old host's pace.
//! - **The drop.** A player still absent [`DROP_AFTER`] after the takeover is
//!   dropped as a silent player is: its plane goes to the AI, reserved for it
//!   (slice K5), and its token brings it back later.
//!
//! **The old host.** A host that hears Taken over (52) from a standby, or
//! that loses every remote player at once while it had a ready standby
//! ([`Host::lost_everyone`]), has its game ask standby 1 whether it hosts
//! now ([`reach_packet`], [`hosting_answer`]); once it does, the host steps
//! down without a word ([`Host::step_down`]) and its game's own client
//! resumes like any other. A host that leaves on purpose hands over
//! ([`Host::hand_over`]): Handover to standby 1 after its last tick and Host
//! moving (51) to every player.
//!
//! *Agent decisions (K4)*, each in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's K4 row:
//!
//! - **T and the exact state.** T is the tick the new host steps next (the
//!   world's `tick()`); Resumed's exact state is the plane's as tick T
//!   begins, which a client's prediction labels T - 1, and the Backlog's
//!   first tick is T. A player who resumes after the fast-forward has passed
//!   T is resumed at the host's tick then.
//! - **Absent players** are kept outside the connection table, each under a
//!   placeholder connection id that the revivals part may name; a resume
//!   renames it by coding the revivals part again (slice K1's coders, which
//!   name connections by join order).
//! - **Inputs while resuming** are kept per resumed seat and fed to its input
//!   buffer one tick at a time as the fast-forward reaches each, commands at
//!   their tick in number order, so a backlog seconds long is neither dropped
//!   as too far ahead nor applied early; at the present what is left goes in
//!   at once.
//! - **The crown** stays with its holder; a King who never resumes is
//!   dropped and the crown passes as for any departing King.
//! - **The house** is the new host's own player; the old house is a player
//!   like any other, but one that handed over has left and is not expected.
