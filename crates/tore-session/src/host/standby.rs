//! The host's standby stream (stage K; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Standbys"),
//! built by slice K3: appointing and dismissing up to two standbys, the
//! journal's records out to each on its own connection, the state parts
//! after their tick, a Check every 600 ticks to the warm ones, a checkpoint
//! every 1,200 ticks to the cold ones, the pacing of those checkpoints, each
//! standby's status in, the resync a standby asks for, and a leaving standby
//! replaced.
//!
//! The host calls [`Host::standby_update`] at the end of every update, after
//! the ticks and the parts they changed. It drains the journal (slice K1)
//! and gives each standby its records in order:
//!
//! - **Ticks** wait in each stream until a snapshot interval of them (four at
//!   30 snapshots a second) is there, and go out as one Ticks record; any
//!   other record sends the waiting ticks first, so the stream keeps the
//!   journal's order.
//! - **State, Flight and Ended** go out as they come. A Flight or an Ended
//!   drops a checkpoint still going out: it belongs to the flight before.
//! - **Checks** go to the warm standbys at the first update at or after each
//!   600th tick, with the hash of the world between ticks then, named by the
//!   world's `tick()`.
//! - **Checkpoints** go to a standby appointed in flight, to a cold one at the
//!   first update 1,200 ticks after its last, and to one that asks for one (a
//!   failed check, a fall behind). A checkpoint goes in 4 KB chunks at a
//!   paced rate, at most four unacknowledged; Ticks and State records are
//!   never paced.
//!
//! *Agent decisions (K3)*, each in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's K3 row:
//!
//! - **Off until asked.** A host appoints no standby until its caller
//!   switches them on ([`Host::set_standbys_enabled`]): a game that cannot
//!   run a standby yet would keep the stream unread.
//! - **Who.** The standbys are slice K6's best candidates
//!   (`Host::ranked_candidates`: in a game a player hosts, not the house,
//!   not relayed, its switch on, reached by every other direct player), less
//!   any leaving or dismissed as behind in this flight. A standby is kept
//!   while it may stay (`Host::may_stay_standby`: as eligible, but a player
//!   not yet in a reach test does not count against it, so a join does not
//!   dismiss the standbys); a free role is filled from the ranking. A
//!   remaining standby keeps the role it was appointed with: appointing it
//!   again would cost it a checkpoint and leave it not ready meanwhile.
//! - **Warm or cold.** A standby is warm when its Candidate report's class
//!   (platform and processor) is the host's; the checks find any difference
//!   within 5 seconds, and after [`MISMATCHES_TO_COLD`] failed checks the
//!   standby is appointed again, cold.
//! - **Succession.** Whenever the standbys or their readiness change, the
//!   ready ones go to K6's `send_succession`, which sends every player the
//!   Succession when it differs from the last.
//! - **Pacing.** The rate is the checkpoint's bytes over 8 seconds, at least
//!   32,000 and at most [`MAX_RATE`] bytes a second less the rest of the
//!   stream's bytes in the last second, so the whole stream with the
//!   transport's framing stays within John's 1 Mbit/s whenever the journal
//!   leaves room for the slowest pace. "Unacknowledged" is
//!   read from the transport's count of the connection's queued fragments,
//!   since the transport names no message's delivery.
//! - **Room on the wire.** In flight a player's packets carry 256 bytes of
//!   reliable messages each; the stream asks the transport for packets of
//!   messages alone, one for each fragment it queued and at most
//!   [`EXTRA_PACKETS`] an update, while the standby's connection has
//!   messages due, so the stream is not held to the snapshot packets'
//!   share.
//! - **Status.** A status from a game that is not a standby is ignored (a
//!   dismissed standby's last one may cross its Dismiss). A standby that
//!   reports itself behind is dismissed and not appointed again until the
//!   next flight. A checkpoint it asks for goes out at once, unless one is
//!   still going out to it or finished less than [`RESYNC_WAIT`] ago.
//! - **The host's log and status line.** [`Host::standby_figures`] gives each
//!   standby's role, state, checks and stream bytes; the printers belong to
//!   the game and the server (slices K7a and K9).
