//! The host session: one mission's `World` on a fixed 120 Hz clock, the
//! transport's server endpoint, and one record per connection (its seat, its
//! input buffer, its wire state and its event queue). See
//! docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "The host session" and "Joining, leaving and the end
//! of a mission"; the dedicated server's rules are docs/DEDICATED-SERVER.md,
//! "The mission lifecycle".
//!
//! The host never reads a clock or touches a socket for the mission: the
//! caller passes the time in ([`Host::update`]), feeds it datagrams
//! ([`Host::receive`]) and sends what it gives ([`Host::poll_transmit`]).
//! Only the tick-cost statistic reads the process's clock, and nothing the
//! mission does depends on it.
//!
//! Each tick the host applies joins and departures as `MissionCommand::Take`
//! and `GiveBack`, takes every seat's input from its buffer, steps the world,
//! sorts the tick's output into each connection's events, notes what each
//! player's game could not foresee, and every few ticks sends each seated
//! player a snapshot and, when due, its plane's exact state.
//!
//! Before the mission flies, and again after each mission, the host is in its
//! **lobby** (slice EF4, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "The lobby"): players stay
//! connected, take slots, choose loadouts and mark ready; the King (in a game
//! a player hosts) changes the mission, starts it, ends it and kicks; a
//! dedicated server starts as its `start` setting says. Every player is sent
//! the lobby's state whenever it changes.
//!
//! Stage F phase 2 (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Phase 2: the rest of stage F")
//! adds the King's settings ([`crate::settings`]), the crown, revival,
//! scoring, the results, observers and the idle aircraft, each in a module
//! of its own (`king`, `revive`, `score`, `results`, `observe`, `away`) that
//! this one calls.
//!
//! Stage K (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Host migration and rejoin") steps the
//! world through the journal ([`crate::journal::apply_tick`]) and adds its
//! own modules (`journal`, `standby`, `resume`, `rejoin`, `succession`,
//! `state`), each a seam slice K0 placed for a later slice to fill.
//!
//! Stage L (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Compatibility") adds each player's
//! content, the gaps it leaves and the words about them (`content`): a
//! mission or a loadout that uses an item in a gap is refused, and a player
//! who cannot fly the mission is unable in words about the item.

// Stage F phase 2's parts (slice F2-0 adds them as hooks; each slice in
// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Phase 2 slices", fills its own).
