//! The standby's side of host migration (stage K; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
//! "Standbys", "On the standby's side"): [`Standby`], a state machine that
//! takes the standby stream's records in order
//! ([`crate::journal::StreamReader`]), builds the fresh world and keeps a
//! spare built ahead, assembles and restores checkpoints ([`assemble`]),
//! replays ticks with [`crate::journal::apply_tick`] within a budget, keeps
//! the state parts, checks the host's hashes and reports its status; and
//! [`StandbyThread`], the worker thread that runs it in the game and in
//! `tore-bot`, never on the frame loop. A joined client passes the records on
//! unread ([`crate::Client::take_standby_records`]). Built by slice K2.
//!
//! How it holds the mission:
//!
//! - **Warm** (appointed warm): a copy of the host's world, stepped with each
//!   Ticks record as it arrives, a few ticks behind the host. It keeps no
//!   journal but the ticks it has not stepped yet. Each Check the host sends
//!   is compared with the copy's own hash at that tick.
//! - **Cold** (appointed cold, or warm without a copy): a base (the Flight's
//!   fresh world, or the newest checkpoint) and the journal since. It steps
//!   nothing until it takes over.
//!
//! *Agent decisions (K2)*, each in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's K2 row:
//!
//! - A warm copy more than [`FALL_BEHIND_TICKS`] (2 seconds) behind the
//!   journal it holds is catching up, reported cold; if it loses another 2
//!   seconds it falls: it keeps its own checkpoint as a cold base (so it
//!   stays ready), drops the copy and asks for a checkpoint. The host's
//!   checkpoint, once whole, is restored at once and stepped up to the
//!   present, and the standby is warm again within [`CAUGHT_UP_TICKS`] of
//!   the journal's end. A burst of records it can step through does not
//!   make it fall.
//! - A Check that differs drops the copy and everything stepped from it: a
//!   base this machine stepped to would differ the same way. The standby is
//!   building (not ready) until a checkpoint arrives.
//! - A Check's tick is the world's [`World::tick`] when hashed, the tick the
//!   next step runs, as a checkpoint's tick is.
//! - A record that cannot be read breaks the stream, since every later
//!   seat input codes against the inputs before it: the standby reports
//!   itself behind until an Appoint or a Flight starts it afresh. A chunk
//!   that cannot be read only spoils its checkpoint, which is asked for
//!   again.
//! - Appointed in flight, the host sends Appoint and then a checkpoint, no
//!   Flight record: the standby builds the flight its game holds for the
//!   Appoint's mission ([`MissionKey`] with no spec hash), and the
//!   checkpoint's mission identity checks the build.
