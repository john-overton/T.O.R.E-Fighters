//! Pylons and the stores still on them, drawn under every aircraft that
//! carries a combat loadout (B3 and BP2, docs/spec/stores-on-pylons.md).
//!
//! Retail draws no stores on aircraft; this is an opinionated addition John
//! asked for on 2026-10-12. What each station holds comes from the render
//! snapshot ([`StorePose`]); this module only turns it into vertices:
//!
//! - **Where.** A station's stores hang where the simulation says they
//!   do ([`hung`], [`tore_sim::combat::hardpoints::Rack::store_point`]):
//!   a paired station's split between its position and its mirror, a wing
//!   side with two stores (or four or more) on an inboard and an outboard
//!   pylon, a fuselage side's in tandem; a wing store's lugs 1 ft under the
//!   model's underside over its pylon, a fuselage or centreline store's
//!   2 inches under the body on a short rail, and a wingtip store's centre
//!   line on the tip's edge with nothing drawn under it (John 2026-10-13).
//!   A store on a pylon's shoulder rail (the F-14's glove pylon AIM-9)
//!   hangs beside that pylon on an arm ([`shoulder_rail`]).
//!   A released store leaves from that same point, so it never jumps.
//! - **Several on one pylon** hang off a small bar at the pylon's foot: two
//!   alongside it, one each side, as a wingtip missile sits on the tip
//!   (John 2026-10-13); three as a triple ejector rack (one each side, one
//!   under the bar), four as two pairs one behind another, more as triple
//!   racks one behind another. The slots keep the full load's layout, and
//!   the highest-numbered slot empties first.
//! - **Stores** use the weapon's own shape, refitted to the real store's size
//!   ([`crate::store_sizes`]). Retail has no rocket pod or fuel tank shape,
//!   so those, and a store with no shape, are fitted bodies.
//! - **Pylons** are fitted slabs from the top of the store's body (its lugs)
//!   up into the model's underside, each corner meeting the surface above
//!   it ([`Airframe::underside`]). A store on a wing station with nothing
//!   of the model above it hangs on a rail that joins the wing's edge beside
//!   it ([`Airframe::tip_edge`]).
//!   A pylon stays when its stores are gone.
//!
//! All geometry is solid colour in the aircraft vertex format, so it joins
//! the batch of the aircraft it hangs from with no extra draw call.
