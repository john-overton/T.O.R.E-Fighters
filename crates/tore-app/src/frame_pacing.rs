//! When the window draws its next frame: the Graphics screen's frame rate
//! choice, and the throttles for a paused, unfocused or hidden window.
//!
//! Presentation only. The simulation is not paced here: every flight frame
//! still turns the wall time since the last frame into 120 Hz ticks (clamped
//! to 0.25 s, every owed tick run), and a networked flight's ticks are the
//! session's. Drawing fewer frames changes how often the picture is shown,
//! never what the simulation computes.
//!
//! - **V-sync** (the default, John 2026-10-19) presents with `Fifo`: the
//!   display paces the frames, one per refresh, and the next flight frame is
//!   asked for as soon as one is presented. `Fifo` is used rather than
//!   `Mailbox` plus a timer at the monitor's refresh because a timer is not
//!   locked to the display: its small drift against the refresh shows as a
//!   doubled or dropped frame every so often, which is the uneven pacing
//!   V-sync is chosen to avoid (agent decision, 2026-10-19).
//! - **60, 100, 200** present without waiting for the display (`Mailbox`, so
//!   nothing tears, else `Immediate`, else `Fifo`) and a timer spaces the
//!   frames: the event loop sleeps until each frame's time (`WaitUntil`),
//!   never spinning.
//! - `TORE_FRAME_LIMIT` overrides the saved choice for one run: `vsync`,
//!   `60`, `100`, `200`, or `off` for uncapped benchmark rendering
//!   (`Immediate`, else `Mailbox`, else `Fifo`, with no unfocused cap), which
//!   the menu does not offer. Scripted runs, performance measurements,
//!   captures and smoke tests draw uncapped unless the variable is set.
//!
//! - **The frame-rate counter** (Graphics > Display, or `TORE_SHOW_FPS=1`)
//!   measures real frames, so while it is shown every screen draws
//!   continuously at the chosen rate, menus, the lobby, loading screens and a
//!   paused flight included (John, 2026-10-19). Hidden, the low-power pacing
//!   below applies unchanged. See [`counted`] and [`too_soon`].
//!
//! Throttles that need no choice (agent rules from the 2026-10-19
//! optimization plan): a stopped single-player flight with a still camera
//! draws only when something happens (input, a menu animation, a notice
//! expiring); an unfocused window draws about ten frames a second; a hidden
//! window (occluded, or minimised to no size) draws nothing. Scripted runs,
//! performance measurements, captures and smoke tests are never throttled.
