//! City fill buildings (`tore_world::city`), drawn in three tiers set by the
//! Graphics screen (John, 2026-10-10; defaults 30 nm and 5 nm): full detail
//! (the kit piece with its textures) inside the building detail distance, a
//! blend band a quarter beyond it where each building cross-fades from its
//! far box to full detail, and the far box (its footprint in its brightened
//! mean colour, untextured, a cheap shader) out to the building distance.
//! Anything smaller than one pixel on screen is not drawn.
//!
//! Transitions fade (John, 2026-10-11: "let's try phase in transitions"):
//! a building fades in over the last [`FADE_SHARE`] of the building
//! distance and while it grows from one to two pixels on screen, and in the
//! blend band the full building is drawn whole with its box over it at the
//! remaining coverage. Coverage is a fixed ordered dither across each pixel's
//! samples (`fill_coverage` in terrain.wgsl), so a resolved 4x pixel blends
//! in quarter steps, nothing is sorted and a still view never shimmers. Only
//! the far boxes, and full detail in a view whose full detail reaches the
//! fade band, use the dithered fragment shaders; the full detail passes of
//! the main view keep their early depth test. The target display (camera
//! slot 4: the target window and the TV and gunsight views) draws every
//! building it sees at full detail, culled to its own narrow view, and fades
//! at its draw distance too.
//!
//! The per-view work is on the GPU: a compute pass culls every building
//! against the view and writes the full detail lists per piece and the far
//! box list, and indirect draws read them (one per piece and pass, plus one
//! for every far box). The buildings sit on the GPU in spatial blocks of up
//! to 256 ([`blocks`]); the CPU drops the blocks no drawn building can be
//! in and writes one small uniform and the visible block list per view.
//! Knocked-down buildings draw as a low stub (0.08 of their height, in the
//! cull shader); a knock-down rewrites only the changed records.
//! Buildings within [`SHADOW_NM`] cast their box's shadow into the shadow
//! maps.
