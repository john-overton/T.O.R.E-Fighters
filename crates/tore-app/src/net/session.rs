//! The game's end of a networked flight: the client session, its socket and
//! files, the mission the drawn half is built from, and the plain data the
//! flight screen takes from them each frame. Windows, sound and the screens
//! stay in `main.rs`; this file holds what needs no `App`.
//!
//! The mission is built twice before the player is asked for a plane: once
//! by the client session (`World::new`, open seating, which is what the
//! manifest check reads) and once here with the game's own loaders, so the
//! drawn model of every aircraft type loads the way the Quick Mission
//! creator loads them and `CombatView` can draw it. The second world is the
//! app's copy of the mission: never stepped, it gives the screens the
//! terrain, the roster and the aircraft types (agent decision).
//!
//! A join through the Internet Lobby ([`Transport::Internet`]) carries on
//! here after the master's introduction (slice J5): the race of the host's
//! addresses, the relay when none answers, the 15-second give-up and a line
//! in Messages for each step ([`MasterTransport`]; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
//! "Joining through the master").
//!
//! Stage K (slice K7a; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Host migration and rejoin"):
//! a game joined by address binds a dual-stack socket on the game port when
//! it is free ([`Join::to`]), its future host socket. A peers router
//! (`tore_net::peers::Peers`) sits in front of every joined socket: it
//! answers the host's reach tests and passes the rest to the client. A
//! joined game that may host runs a standby ([`crate::net::standby`]) and,
//! when its client says so, takes the game over: the socket goes to a new
//! hosting thread ([`HostThread::take_over`]), the client resumes with its
//! own new host over the in-process link, and the keepalive thread stops. A
//! hosting game whose thread steps down has its socket back and its client
//! resumes with the game's new host like any other.
