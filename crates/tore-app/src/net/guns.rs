//! The gun rounds a networked client draws: its own at once from its trigger
//! and its predicted aircraft, and every other aircraft's from the host's gun
//! burst events (slice D8c; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Hits and lag compensation").
//!
//! The host sends a burst as an event (shooter, gun station, first tick, and
//! the burst again with its length once it is over), never its rounds. The
//! rounds are made again here with the simulation's own rules
//! ([`tore_sim::combat::gun_round`]): the muzzle, the spread, the launch speed,
//! the way a round flies and the cadence the gun releases them on. They are
//! cosmetic. They hit nothing on the client, and the host decides every hit.
//!
//! Nothing here changes the simulation. The rounds are added to the picture as
//! ordinary [`ProjectilePose`]s with `gun: true` and the tracer flag, so the
//! drawing that already shows a host's rounds shows them.
//!
//! An AC-130's guns are trained (docs/spec/ac130-linked-guns.md): a round
//! of one leaves the tip of its barrel along the barrel, as the host's does
//! ([`gunship::muzzle`], [`gunship::direction`]), with the barrel's train as
//! the picture draws it (the snapshot's gun devices). The seat's own linked
//! guns all fire at once from its trigger, each on its own cadence.
//!
//! *Agent decisions:* the spread of a round comes from a number only this
//! side knows (the host seeds it with the round's projectile number, which no
//! message carries), so a round's line can differ from the host's within the
//! gun's half-degree cone; another aircraft's tracer pattern runs on from the
//! rounds its earlier bursts made (every third round, as the host's does),
//! starting at the first burst this client has seen of that gun; other
//! aircraft's rounds are placed from the shooter's pose drawn now, taken back
//! along its velocity to the round's release tick; a burst the host has not
//! closed yet is drawn as running on, and the rounds it overran are taken
//! back when the closing event comes (the picture's delay keeps that from
//! showing in practice); an AC-130's rounds take the train its pose had at
//! the round's release tick, from the poses the client has drawn (the
//! nearest two, blended), and the seat's own take the train its aircraft is
//! drawn with now, the host's newest readout's; the seat's own linked guns
//! fire while the readout says each may (armed, loaded and not blocked by
//! the airframe), solved or not, as the host's do.
