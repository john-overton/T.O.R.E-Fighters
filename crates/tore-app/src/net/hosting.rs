//! The host inside the game (slice EF3 of stage E): the hosting player's game
//! runs the stage D `tore_session::Host` on a thread of its own, with its
//! own fixed 120 Hz clock and its UDP socket on the game port, exactly as the
//! dedicated server runs it, and joins it as an ordinary client over the
//! in-process link (`tore_net::link`). See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "The host
//! inside the game (stage E)".
//!
//! The thread builds the `Host` itself, so the window never waits for the
//! mission to build, and then runs the dedicated server's loop: receive,
//! update, transmit, wait until the next wake (`tore_net::wait_until`, which
//! sleeps and then spins). The game talks to it through two channels:
//! [`Command`]s in and [`Report`]s out. Every choice here is an agent
//! decision unless it is credited.
//!
//! - **Stop.** [`Command::Stop`] is the hosting player leaving the game
//!   (EF4): a flying mission ends for everyone with "the host left the
//!   game" and their debriefs, every player is told the host left and is
//!   disconnected once that is acknowledged. The thread waits at most
//!   [`STOP_GRACE`] for that, then disconnects whoever is left with "server
//!   stopping", closes its socket and ends; the game waits at most
//!   [`JOIN_LIMIT`] for it. A game that drops its end of the channel stops
//!   the thread the same way.
//! - **The lobby** (EF4). The hosting player's own connection is the house
//!   ([`HostConfig::house`] is the link's address), which wears the crown
//!   when it joins, so the King's verbs (change the mission and the
//!   settings, start, end the mission, kick, pass the crown) go over that
//!   connection as messages, as a remote King's do since phase 2, and not
//!   through [`Command`].
//! - **Panic.** A panic on the thread is caught: it tries once to disconnect
//!   every player with "server stopping" (best effort: the host may be
//!   broken), closes the socket and reports [`End::Panicked`], which the game
//!   shows as "The game you were hosting stopped: ...". A remote player the
//!   disconnect does not reach sees the client's own timeout message.
//! - **The port** is closed before the thread reports its end, so a new host
//!   on the same port binds at once.
//! - **On time on macOS** (EF-M). The thread holds an `NSProcessInfo`
//!   activity, latency-critical and user-initiated, from its start to its
//!   end, so App Nap does not slow a hidden hosting game, and once the
//!   mission is built it gives itself a Mach time-constraint policy for the
//!   120 Hz tick (`tore_realtime_native`), whose timers macOS does not
//!   coalesce. It logs once what took ("Host: macOS real-time scheduling
//!   on", or why not). Both do nothing on Linux and Windows.
//! - **Listing** (slice I3). A game started with a [`Listing`] reads and
//!   writes its socket through a `tore_net::master::HostListing`, so the
//!   master's datagrams never reach the host, and lists itself on the
//!   Internet Lobby while it is told to ([`Command::SetListed`]). It reports
//!   where the listing stands ([`Report::Listing`]) and unregisters as the
//!   thread stops, before its socket closes. A game started without one
//!   (Direct Connection) never talks to the master until its King makes it
//!   public. *Agent decision:* the listing goes beside [`HostSetup`]
//!   ([`HostThread::start_listed`]) rather than in it, so the hosts the
//!   tests build stay as they are.
//! - **The King's Visibility** (stage F phase 2, slice F2-1). The thread
//!   follows the host's `visibility` setting as it follows
//!   [`Command::SetListed`]: when the King makes the game public it is
//!   listed, and when the King makes it local or hidden it is taken off.
//!   A game started without a listing gets one then, on the public master
//!   and with no telemetry (agent decision: the King asked for the listing;
//!   the statistics wait for the Internet Lobby's notice). Only a change
//!   counts, so a game started listed while its setting says local stays
//!   listed until the King or the screen says otherwise.
//! - **Port mapping** (stage J, slice J4b). A game started with a
//!   [`Forward`] ([`HostThread::start_forwarded`]) asks the router to
//!   forward the game port on a thread of its own ([`forward::Forwarder`]),
//!   from the moment the socket is bound. The thread's news reaches the
//!   host thread's loop, which gives the listing the Mapped candidate
//!   (`HostListing::set_mapped`), keeps the telemetry value for the Report
//!   and tells the game ([`Report::Forward`], whose lines the lobby shows).
//!   When the host stops, the mapping is removed before the thread reports
//!   its end, in at most [`forward::REMOVE_WAIT`]; the removal starts as
//!   soon as the stop is asked for, so it runs while the players are told.
//! - **Host migration** (stage K, slice K7a; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Host
//!   migration and rejoin"). The host keeps standbys
//!   (`Host::set_standbys_enabled`) and journals the listing's part
//!   (`Host::set_listing_part`) whenever the listing may have changed. A
//!   stop with a ready standby hands the game over (`Host::hand_over`)
//!   instead of ending it, and the thread ends without a word to anyone
//!   once the standby has the last tick ([`End::HandedOver`]), the listing
//!   released for the new host. A host that loses every player at once or
//!   hears it was taken over asks standby 1, every [`ASK_EVERY`], whether it
//!   hosts now; when it answers so the host steps down and the thread hands
//!   the socket back to the game ([`HostThread::take_socket`],
//!   [`End::SteppedDown`]), whose client resumes with the new host. A game
//!   that takes the game over starts its thread with
//!   [`HostThread::take_over`]: the thread builds the new host from the
//!   game's standby (`standby::takeover::take_over_thread`), on the socket
//!   the game joined with, behind the game's peers router, which still
//!   hands the old host's datagrams to the game's client ([`Side`]), and it
//!   resumes the old host's listing from the listing part.
