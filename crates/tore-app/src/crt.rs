//! A small, reusable CRT display look: a picture (and an optional overlay
//! of symbology) shown as on a monochrome sensor monitor, with mild
//! pixelation and soft focus, slight chromatic aberration, scanlines, a
//! vignette, fine noise and occasional bursts of static.
//!
//! Two forms share one set of rules:
//!
//! - [`Crt`], a GPU pass (`crt.wgsl`) that composes a source texture and an
//!   overlay texture into a target. The AC-130 sensor console draws its
//!   full-screen picture through it ([`crate::sensor_console`]).
//! - [`apply_cpu`], the same look on a small RGBA buffer in place, for the
//!   instrument pages that are drawn on the CPU (the target camera's
//!   138 x 114 page, say for a second of static when a seeker weapon hits).
//!
//! [`Static`] decides when the occasional bursts come and lets a caller ask
//! for one ([`Static::burst`]). Presentation only: nothing here reads or
//! feeds the simulation, and the bursts run on the frame clock.
//!
//! Every constant in [`SENSOR`] and [`Static`] is an agent decision
//! (nr-fltv, 2026-10-13), tuned on offscreen renders to be noticeable but
//! not in the way; John asked for "nice static occasionally and a bit of
//! chromatic aberration and pixelation to make it look like a CRT display"
//! (opinionated, John, 2026-10-13).

/// How strong each part of the look is. Pixel sizes are for a 1080-row
/// output and scale with the output's height.
