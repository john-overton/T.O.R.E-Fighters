//! Released chaff and flares: one `combat.countermeasure` entry per device,
//! exact enough for a replay to fly the device again, and the player's own
//! decoy rolls, which explain the shots they decoyed. The AI's rolls come
//! from the bridge in [`super::why`]. Everything here drains write-only
//! records; nothing feeds back. Opinionated addition requested by John on
//! 2026-09-26; the entries' layout is an agent decision. See
