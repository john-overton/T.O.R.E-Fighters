//! Any moment of a recording, rebuilt from the recording alone: the picture
//! combat draws (from the nearest keyframe, a chunk at a time), smoke and
//! contrails (from their release ticks), and the player's wing vapor (from
//! the last 250 ticks of recorded poses). Nothing here depends on how the
//! playhead got to a tick, so reverse play shows exactly what forward play
//! showed. Playing forward only steps what the playhead crossed (the puffs
//! released since the last tick drawn, the poses since it); a seek, reverse
//! play or a long jump rebuilds from the recording as ever, and the tests
//! hold both ways to the same result at every tick. A few decoded chunks
