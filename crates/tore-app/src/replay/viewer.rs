//! The mission replay viewer: plays a recording back from any viewpoint.
//! Opinionated addition requested by John on 2026-09-26; see
//! docs/REPLAYS.md. The picture comes from the same drawing helpers and the
//! same renderer calls as live flight, fed from the recording; every
//! interface choice here is an agent design (2026-09-26).
//!
//! The viewer owns its own world and aircraft models. Entering it points
//! the renderer at them; leaving hands the renderer back to the game's.
