//! The AI strike driver: `--a2g-run THEATER STEM --pilot ai` (plan section 5,
//! slice ST-D, `.local/ai-a2g/plan.md`).
//!
//! The player-side kinds of this driver fly an aircraft through the seat's
//! own controls. This one lets the AI fly it: the aircraft starts `--from` NM
//! short of the target on the pass `--heading`, `--altitude`, `--speed` and
//! `--dive` describe, and from the first tick the AI's own controller flies
//! it, in the same mission step as the game. The driver only watches and
//! reports what the simulation shows. Every line starts `ai-strike:`.
//!
//! ```text
//! --a2g-run THEATER STEM --pilot ai [--aircraft ID] [--load REC] [--target N]
//!     [--station N] [--count N] [--skill 0..3]
//!     [--profile straight|popup|fasthigh|dive|level|orbit|standoff]
//!     [--handback S [--mode ccip|lvl] [--trigger] [--laser] [--take-back S]]
//!     [--order KIND [--order-at S]] [--quick-wing] [--render OUT.png --render-at S]
//!     [--choose-store] [--buddy ID]
//!     [--from NM] [--altitude FT] [--speed KT] [--heading DEG] [--dive DEG]
//!     [--defenses AAA SAM] [--surface-seed N] [--seconds S]
//! ```
//!
//! - `--aircraft`, `--load`, `--station`, `--count`: the striker and its store,
//!   fitted as the player-side kinds fit it (a store the aircraft does not
//!   carry is fitted to a bomb, pod or missile station for the run).
//! - `--target N`: the Nth ground target of the stem (0 by default).
//! - `--skill 0..3`: the striker's wing, Novice to Ace (Average by default).
//! - `--profile`: **forces** the pass for coverage. The real AI chooses its
//!   pass from the perceived threat and its energy (John, 2026-10-11, answer
//!   3); the flag exists so a test can fly each pass once.
//! - `--handback S`: a human-flown run handed to the AI. A seat flies the
//!   striker on the scripted pass, designates the target, selects the store
//!   (and `--mode` of the bomb sight) and gives the aircraft back to the AI
//!   `S` seconds into the pass, for the takeover tests. `--trigger` has the
//!   human hold the trigger from the selection on (pickle and hold), so a
//!   bomb is released, and reported, before the handoff. `--laser` has the
//!   human turn the laser on by hand (Ctrl+L) once the store is selected.
//!   `--take-back S`: the seat takes the aircraft again `S` seconds after the
//!   handback, and the run ends there with what the human finds (slice
//!   ST-K, docs/spec/ai-strike.md "Takeover and handback").
//! - `--order KIND`: wing orders. The seat leads a two-ship wing on the
//!   scripted pass, designates the target and gives the wingman (the striker)
//!   the order `--order-at S` seconds into the pass (5 by default). Kinds:
//!   see [`ORDERS`]; the orders the strike round adds join that table.
//! - `--quick-wing`: a Quick Mission's own strike wing (slice ST-O). No seat
//!   flies and nothing orders it: friendly wing 2 is two `--aircraft`, and the
//!   mission's default role (bomber-class aircraft strike when a ground target
//!   is set) sends it. It starts where the mission puts it and flies to the
//!   target itself; `ROLE` reports the role it was given.
//!
//! - `--choose-store`: the AI chooses its own store instead of the fitted
//!   one (slice ST-L): a laser store only with a spot assured.
//! - `--buddy ID`: a second seat flies aircraft ID as a buddy of the striker
//!   (slice ST-L): a scripted pass 1 nm ahead of the striker, 3,000 ft right
//!   and 1,000 ft higher, which designates the nearest ground object with
//!   Ctrl+X and lases it by hand (Ctrl+L). The striker is then ordered onto
//!   what the buddy designated. A striker with no designator of its own drops
//!   on the buddy's spot; the RELEASE line names the spot's owner.
//!
//! What it prints, in this order, then one `summary` and `done`:
//!
//! - `setup`: the aircraft, store, target, skill, forced profile, handback
//!   and order.
//! - `start`: the striker's place at tick 0 (range to the target, altitude).
//! - `HANDBACK`, `ORDER`: the handoff and the order, with what was kept.
//! - `TAKEOVER`: what the AI continues after a handback (target, station,
//!   bomb sight mode), or `none`.
//! - `KEPT`: the kept cockpit while the AI flies it (mode, laser hand
//!   setting and state, selected station), each time that changes.
//! - `TAKEBACK`: a `--take-back`: what the human finds (designation,
//!   station, mode, laser, rounds left).
//! - `PROFILE name=P requested=R`: the pass the AI reports it flies. `none`
//!   until slice ST-T reports one (see [`reported_profile`]).
//! - `RELEASE`: a store left the striker (time, store, station, height above
//!   the ground, speed, range to the target, rounds left).
//! - `IMPACT miss_ft=F`: a released round ended, and how far (horizontal) from
//!   the target it ended.
//! - `BURST`: an AC-130 burst began (its gun rounds are not RELEASE lines):
//!   its number, its walked-in aim offset, and the orbit's radius, height,
//!   slant range and bank (slice ST-F).
//! - `KILL`: a ground object the striker destroyed.
//! - `EGRESS`: after a release the striker is opening from the target (one
//!   nautical mile past its closest approach).
//! - `LOST`: the striker was destroyed, crashed, ejected or left the AI.
//! - `ACTIVITY`: what the AI says it is doing, each time that changes.
//! - `PHASE`: the striker's strike phase (ingress, attack, lase, exit, ...)
//!   each time it changes (slice ST-L); `HOLD` every five seconds of a lase
//!   hold: its range from the target, height above it, speed and bank.
//! - `NOLAZE decision=D reason=R weapon=W station=S target=T words="..."`: a
//!   striker with laser stores and no laser support decided (slice ST-G):
//!   `manual` (a laser bomb let go as an unguided bomb) or `rtb` (a laser
//!   store that cannot fall unguided, so home), once, with the radio's
//!   words; the replay records it as an `ai.strike` event.
//! - `LASER plane=P state=S mask=M`: the laser of the striker, and of the
//!   buddy when there is one, each time its state or mask changes (slice
//!   ST-L). The summary counts the seconds a laser weapon of the run was in
//!   flight guiding (`fall_s`) and how many of them the spot it followed was
//!   lost (`blind_s`).
//!
//! The hooks the strike slices fill are in one place, [`hooks`]: ST-T makes
//! the AI take the target and report its profile, ST-K reports what a takeover
//! kept, ST-O adds order kinds. Until they land the driver reports what the
//! existing AI does with a ground target, which is nothing (no RELEASE), and
//! says so.
