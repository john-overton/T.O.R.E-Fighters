//! Shots fired by surface units, ground units and ships: SAMs, AAA and flak
//! (docs/spec/surface-defenses.md, "SAM missiles" and "AAA and flak").
//!
//! A surface unit is a ground target row in [`State`] with its own id. Its
//! controller (slice W3, `ai::surface`) decides when and where to fire; this
//! module turns one shot into a projectile with [`State::fire_surface`] and
//! keeps what the shot needs beyond an aircraft's round:
//!
//! - **Ids** come from their own counter, from
//!   [`SURFACE_PROJECTILE_ID_BASE`] up, so they never meet the ownships'
//!   (from 0) or the AI aircraft's (from `1 << 24`).
//! - **The weapon record travels with the round** (`Projectile::weapon` is
//!   always set), so nothing looks for the owner among the ownships.
//! - **Gun rounds** are numbered within their game round
//!   (`ordinal % actualRoundsPerGame`) so `projectile_damage` splits a
//!   game round's damage over its physical rounds (the AAA tuning table's
//!   damage rule), and carry tracers as the table says.
//! - **An end tick**, set at launch: a flak shell's time fuze, where it
//!   bursts; any other round's range limit, where it goes away unseen, so a
//!   fast gun's rounds stop at the target's range instead of flying their
//!   whole life (fitted). Each live round's [`SurfaceRound`] is kept by its
//!   projectile id, as the rewinds are.
//! - **Capacity**: a surface shot is refused while fewer than
//!   [`SURFACE_PROJECTILE_RESERVE`] projectile slots would stay free, so AAA
//!   can never use up the room the aircraft's own weapons need (fitted).
//!
//! In flight a surface round differs from an aircraft's in a few fitted ways
//! (`State::step` applies them; the spec has the rules):
//!
//! - It hits aircraft and the terrain only, never a ground object or ship:
//!   surface units do not fight each other this round, and a launcher is never
//!   hit by its own missile on the rail.
//! - A surface gun round does the record's damage, never the aircraft guns'
//!   one-third rule, and never a critical (pilot or central) kill: the
//!   tuning table already matches retail damage per second. A jammer does
//!   not defeat individual gun rounds.
//! - A flak shell bursts at its time fuze, at the end of its life, or as soon
//!   as it passes within its record's fuze radius of a hostile aircraft
//!   in flight. The burst is an [`EffectKind::Flak`] effect with the record's
//!   own explosion type.
//! - A surface round's collateral damage (`collateral.rs`, the rule every
//!   weapon follows) reaches aircraft only.
//!
//! The explosion a destroyed ground object shows comes from its unit's record
//! when the host gives one ([`State::set_ground_look`]).
