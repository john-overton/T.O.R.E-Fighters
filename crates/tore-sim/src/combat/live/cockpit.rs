//! The strike cockpit: one record per aircraft of its ground-attack state,
//! whoever flies it (docs/spec/ai-strike.md, "One cockpit, two pilots";
//! docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "The strike cockpit").
//!
//! The record holds the strike target (a ground object, a ground point, or
//! none), the selected station and whether it is armed, the delivery mode
//! (CCIP or LVL), the seeker mode (CUED or BORE), the targeting sight and the
//! laser with its hand setting. It lives in three places, always the same
//! type:
//!
//! - **A human flying** ([`Ownship::cockpit`]): the keys edit it. The
//!   designation's home stays the aircraft's sensors (the radar pages and
//!   picks); combat copies the designated object into the record's target at
//!   each step and after each command, so everything that reads the record
//!   sees what the human designated.
//! - **A plane a human gave back** ([`Kept::cockpit`], slice FX-J): the AI
//!   flies with what the human left; the sight and the laser step on.
//! - **An AI striker** ([`State::ai_cockpit_mut`]): the AI's strike
//!   controller edits it (target, station, laser on or off) and leaves the
//!   rest alone. An AI aircraft that never had a human gets one the first
//!   time the AI asks for it.
//!
//! One release function serves every launcher ([`State::release_round`]):
//! a human's trigger and an AI's release both turn a station's store into
//! rounds the same way (bomb packs with their offsets and scatter, pod
//! rockets, guided flights with their spot or stored point, the laser's
//! release note). The delivery solution, the guided sight and the guided
//! readiness are shared the same way. The AI releases on the shared solution
//! ([`State::strike_release_due`]); skill enters through [`ReleaseAim`] (the
//! pass's aim offset and release gate), which the strike tactics slice
//! (ST-T) draws. Opinionated (John, 2026-10-11) for the principle; the
//! record layout and the target copy are agent decisions.
