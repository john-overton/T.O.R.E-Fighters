//! The coders of combat's state: ownships, targets, projectiles, effects, the
//! ledger, the rewind history, the random stream and the combat tick
//! (docs/formats/checkpoint.md, section 2). `live::State` is coded as a value;
//! the world's `Combat` wrapper restores it in place around its own setup.
//!
//! Every field of every type here is named, so a field added without coding
//! it fails to compile. What is skipped, with its class:
//!
//! - `State::device_log` and `State::decoy_log`: why-records. They explain the
//!   releases and decoy rolls for a recording, the host drains them, and
//!   nothing in combat reads them back.
//!
//! Everything else is coded, including the fields that look like caches or
//! presentation but a later tick reads: an ownship's `range_estimate` and
//! `mounted_key` refresh only on a change, `sound_events` and `strikes` wait
//! for the host to drain them, and the hit records and the `ownship_rows` are
//! shown before the next step.
//!
//! *Agent decision:* the ground contact volumes (`ground_bounds`) are coded
//! too. The world adds them when it builds the mission, so a restore over the
//! same mission would rebuild them, but `State` is decoded as a value with no
//! fresh state beside it, and they are a few boxes per airport.
//!
//! Weapon records, configurations and signature profiles are shared records
//! (equal copies cost one coding), as the records slice settled.
