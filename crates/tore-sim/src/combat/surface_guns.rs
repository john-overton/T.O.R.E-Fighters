//! The AAA tuning table: how fast each surface gun fires, how many rounds it
//! carries and how long it takes to reload. Spec: docs/spec/surface-defenses.md
//! (section "AAA tuning"), generated from [`TABLE`].
//!
//! John's rule (2026-10-10): AAA and flak fire real physical shells, every gun
//! type has a fitted rate of fire, magazine and reload time, and the numbers
//! start from the retail record where it has them and from real-world figures
//! where it does not. The retail LIB gives every surface gun a short burst
//! and a pause (a ZSU-23 fires 4 rounds in a quarter second, then waits a
//! second) and an unlimited stock; the table gives each a real cyclic rate, a
//! longer burst, a magazine, and a magazine reload of one minute for towed
//! guns and small vehicles and two for self-propelled AA guns and ship guns.
//!
//! Like [`super::gunship::apply_tore_record`] for the AC-130, [`apply`] writes
//! the table onto a loaded record and leaves every other record alone. The
//! record fields it sets are the ones the projectile code already reads:
//!
//! - `game_rounds_in_burst` and `actual_rounds_per_game` (a burst of
//!   `burst` physical rounds is `burst / per_game` game rounds of `per_game`
//!   physical rounds each) and `game_burst_t` (quarter seconds), which give
//!   the cyclic rate while a burst is firing;
//! - `reload_t` (quarter seconds), the pause after a burst, and
//!   `startup_shots`, the opening barrage;
//! - `initial_speed`, `final_speed` and the speed limits, for the muzzle
//!   velocity.
//!
//! **Damage.** A game round does the record's damage (a quarter-second burst
//! of 4 rounds in retail does 4 times it). The table fires more physical
//! rounds a second than retail does, so each game round is split over
//! `per_game` physical rounds: `projectile_damage` in live.rs gives each
//! physical round `damage / per_game` (the remainder spread over the rounds
//! of a game round, so the average is exact) when the shooter sets the
//! round's index within its game round (`ordinal % per_game`, as
//! live.rs does for aircraft guns). Damage per second of sustained fire then
//! matches retail, within the tolerance [`GunTuning::damage_rate_ratio`]
//! reports. Where the table's rate is close to retail, `per_game` is 1 and
//! the retail damage per round stays.
//!
//! **Magazine.** The table's `magazine` is the physical rounds a mount fires
//! before it must reload, and `magazine_reload_s` the time that reload
//! takes; retail stock stays unlimited (`maxItems` 32767). The surface unit
//! state (controller slice W3) holds rounds left and the reload deadline, and
//! a supply truck within 0.1 mile restores a magazine at once or on the same
//! clock (also W3).
//!
//! Provenance (each value, see [`GunTuning::origins`]): *retail* where the
//! number is the LIB record's, *fitted* where an agent chose it from real-world
//! figures, and *opinionated* for the magazine reload times, which John chose.
