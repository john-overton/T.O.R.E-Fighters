//! A helicopter's threat awareness on a strike (docs/spec/ai-strike.md,
//! "Helicopter threat awareness"; John's rule, 2026-10-12; slice H4).
//!
//! - **Aware** of a defence (one in its ground picture, briefed, seen, or a
//!   radar that painted it): the helicopter does not press an attack through
//!   that defence's **ring** (its reach plus a margin). It looks for an
//!   attack that stays outside every ring it knows: the pop-up when the
//!   target and the run in are clear, else a stand-off shot from a firing
//!   point outside the rings ([`plan_attack`]). With none, it **holds off**:
//!   masked, low, outside the rings ([`hold_centre`]), for up to three
//!   minutes while SEAD may kill the site; then it takes another target that
//!   can be attacked from outside every ring, and with none it goes home.
//! - **Not aware** (a MANPAD, a radar that was off, a radar busy with someone
//!   else): when it is engaged by a site it did not know ([`known_shooter`]
//!   finds none; John, 2026-10-29) it breaks (the helicopter defence), then
//!   leaves the place it was engaged from (an **ambush ring**,
//!   [`ambush_ring`]) and stays out until the threat has been quiet for a
//!   minute; then it may resume. A shot from a site it knew is no ambush:
//!   it leaves that site's ring.
//!
//! A ring's reach is the site's real launch reach at a helicopter (the
//! host's bound on its launch gate), and the stand-off's advance the
//! store's time of flight at the helicopter's speed (John, 2026-10-29).
//!
//! Everything is a fixed function of the threats, the positions, the store
//! and the terrain: no dice (John, decision 13). The numbers are fitted
//! (agent) unless marked.
