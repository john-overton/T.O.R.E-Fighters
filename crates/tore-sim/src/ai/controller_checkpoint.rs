//! The coders of an AI pilot's controller and everything it owns directly
//! (docs/formats/checkpoint.md, stage H slice H5): its identity and profile,
//! the maneuver it is flying, the intent batch it last produced, its searches,
//! defense motion and pending launch warnings, and its fitted fallback log.
//! The parts it owns that have their own module (the weapon service, gunnery,
//! formation guidance, wing orders, motion requests, steering mode, pursuit
//! offset and script reason) are coded beside those modules.
//!
//! Three fields are left out, each with its class:
//!
//! - `gun_views` and `formation_traffic` are per-tick scratch (proofs at the
//!   skip);
//! - `trace` is a why-record: nothing reads it, and it is outside equality.

// over with `set_gun_views` on every actor's step, immediately before it
// calls `Controller::step` (`ai/mission.rs`: the call and the step sit in one
// function and no path reaches the step without the call). The only reads are
// inside `step` (station choice and gun tracking), and a step that does not
// advance returns the last batch without reading them. So a restored
// controller starts with none and the next step writes them first.
//
// `formation_traffic`: per-tick scratch for the same reason. The mission
// calls `set_formation_observation` with the tick's traffic before the
// actor's step, and the only read is `formation_point` inside that step.
//
// `trace`: a why-record. `Controller::trace` hands it to the debug panels and
// `thought::Record` takes no part in equality.
