//! The coders of an AI aircraft's mission assignment and rules-of-engagement
//! state, and of the attack reports it keeps (docs/formats/checkpoint.md,
//! stage H slice H4).
//!
//! `GroupObjective` is resolved before the mission starts, and `Priority`,
//! `Selection`, `Explanation` and `ProtectedView` are per-call results; none
//! is held between ticks (the one journal-only `Selection` lives in the
//! why-record `JournalMemory`).
