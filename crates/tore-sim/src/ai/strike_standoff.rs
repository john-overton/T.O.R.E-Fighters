//! A fixed-wing striker's stand-off release outside known rings
//! (docs/spec/ai-strike.md, "Stand-off reach"; T.O.R.E opinionated change,
//! John 2026-10-29: "If an attack aircraft can hit outside of range safely
//! of known threats AI should do that").
//!
//! With a stand-off store selected (a seeker missile, or a guided store
//! released on its sight's bar: a guided bomb, a laser store on a spot
//! that is not its own) and a known defence whose reach covers the target,
//! the striker checks its usual release point: the seeker's fire range, or
//! the sight's bar. When that point, or the turn away after it, lies inside
//! a known ring ([`threat::jet_rings`]), it looks farther out along its
//! line to the target, on the [`reach::SHOT_STEP_FT`] grid, to the store's
//! reliable reach ([`reach::reliable`], the host's exact-point answers): the
//! nearest range whose release point and turn stand outside every ring is
//! its plan ([`ReleasePlan`]). It releases there once the store reaches
//! ([`super::Solution::reaches`]), turns away from the target and opens to
//! the plan's range plus its turn plus [`STANDOFF_EXIT_FT`] before it turns
//! back. With no such range, or with no defence covering the target, the
//! pass is flown as before. The pass types, the line flown and the
//! committed-to-release window are unchanged; the window times the planned
//! release.
