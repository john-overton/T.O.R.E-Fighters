//! The strike tactics (docs/spec/ai-strike.md, slice ST-T): what a striker
//! does with its ground picture, its stores and the shared release.
//!
//! One [`Strike`] per striker (an aircraft with the Strike role or an ordered
//! ground target, [`super::awareness::ground::GroundPicture::active`]). Each
//! mission step it reads the picture, the perceived threat, its own energy
//! and the solution the host worked out from the strike cockpit (the bomb or
//! rocket cue, the guided weapon's reach, a seeker's lock), and answers with
//! an [`Order`]: where to fly (a heading, a flight-path pitch and a speed for
//! the ordinary input-only steering adapter, so the aircraft flies the pass
//! through its own controls), which store to release now, and what it is
//! doing. Nothing here moves the aircraft or makes a round.
//!
//! The flow, all deterministic (John, 2026-10-11, decisions 3 and 13):
//!
//! - **Ingress** toward the target; at 10 nm (or at once when closer) the
//!   striker **chooses**: the target ([`super::targeting::select_strike_target`],
//!   SEAD radars first for an anti-radiation carrier), the store
//!   ([`choose_store`]) and the pass ([`choose_pass`]) from the perceived
//!   threat and the available speed, limited by the bombing class and the
//!   store. A pass draws its aim offset ([`aim_draw`], unguided weapons only).
//! - **Attack**: the pass's approach (retail steering frame: a point offset
//!   above the target, flown straight at), then the final: the cue is flown
//!   onto the aim point and the store is released when the shared release
//!   test passes.
//! - **Exit**: jink inside 10,000 ft, climb out, turn back at
//!   max(30,000 ft, 2R) and choose again: re-attack while the target stands
//!   and a usable store is left, else the next target, else **home**.
//! - **Defend**: a missile or gun defence the existing B47 reactions fly, or
//!   a fighter that threatens the striker, hands control back to the air
//!   logic; once the threat has gone the striker resumes at ingress if it
//!   is safe (the spec's safe test), else egresses and goes home unless it
//!   is safe by the exit distance.
//!
//! - **Lase** ([`lase`], slice ST-L): a striker with its own designator that
//!   releases a laser weapon holds its spot on the target in an offset turn
//!   until the weapon is down, then exits; a lase duty (the wing order) and a
//!   designator lasing for its wing's carriers fly the same hold.
//!
//! Helicopters and the gunship fly their own families (slice ST-F): the
//! helicopter's pop-up and stand-off attack ([`helicopter`]) and the
//! gunship's orbit with its linked guns ([`gunship`]).
