//! Aircraft and surface AI: isolated, spec-derived calculation components.
//!
//! Everything here is built from [`docs/spec/ai.md`](../../../../docs/spec/ai.md)
//! [`docs/spec/ai-experience.md`](../../../../docs/spec/ai-experience.md), and
//! [`docs/spec/ai-awareness.md`](../../../../docs/spec/ai-awareness.md).
//! Behavior IDs (B01, B15, ...) in doc comments refer to those specs. Nothing in
//! this module drives the human player. The mission and steering adapters
//! connect aircraft decisions to physical controls, with synthetic replay tests.
//!
//! Rules of the module:
//!
//! - Unknown behavior returns [`AiError::UnspecifiedRule`]; there are no silent
//!   fallback constants.
//! - Recovered quantities keep their recovered domain. Distances are feet,
//!   angles in recovered rules are degrees, and speeds are feet per second
//!   wrapped in [`ScalarSpeed`].
//! - Randomness is caller-owned [`DecisionRandom`] state. Percentages are draw
//!   thresholds, not a promise to reproduce the original sequence.
//! - The simulation runs at a fixed 120 Hz; nominal timings are simulation
//!   seconds on a quarter-second clock ([`QUARTER_SECOND_TICKS`]).
