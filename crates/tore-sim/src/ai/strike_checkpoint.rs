//! The coders of a striker's strike state (docs/formats/checkpoint.md).
//!
//! Every field the next step reads is coded: the phase and its start, the
//! pass, the target and store, the pass count that seeds the next aim, the
//! drawn aim, the final's line, the release count, the exit's heading, a gun
//! run's burst state and the height the striker was tasked at, and (T.O.R.E,
//! John, 2026-10-28) the release estimate, the committed-to-release window
//! and whether an early retarget's exit is the short one.
//! `inputs` is per-step scratch: the host hands it over before every mission
//! step and the step takes it, so between steps it is always empty and a
//! restored strike starts without it. `Context`, `Order`, `Steer`, `Handling`,
//! `Selection`, `Inputs`, `LaseInputs`, `WingFacts`, `Store`, `Solution`,
//! `PassInputs`, `PassChoice`, `TargetFacts` and `AimDraw` are per-call
//! values, never held. The lase in progress, and whether the aircraft has a
//! designator and laser rounds (slice ST-L), are coded.
