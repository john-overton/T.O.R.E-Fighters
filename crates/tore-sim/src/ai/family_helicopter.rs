//! The helicopter family of the strike tactics (docs/spec/ai-strike.md,
//! "Helicopters"; slice ST-F): the AH-64 and Mi-24 attack with retail's
//! helicopter pop-up, or, with a stand-off weapon under threat Missiles,
//! from low at the weapon's range.
//!
//! - **Pop-up** (retail shape, docs/spec/ai.md B20): toward a
//!   point 1,500 ft above the target until 10,000 ft out, pull 30 degrees
//!   over the line of sight for 6 s, then point at the target until 1,500 ft
//!   or it is no longer ahead. Retail's pull asks for minimum speed by an
//!   operand slip; T.O.R.E keeps its speed through it (John, 2026-10-11:
//!   "maintain proper speed for defense and quick exfil"), and every leg
//!   asks for the helicopter's strike speed, 80% of its maximum (John,
//!   2026-10-13: "about 120 kt"; [`crate::ai::helicopter_defense::strike_speed`]).
//!   Until slice HF1 every leg asked for the maximum.
//! - **Stand-off** ([`Pass::StandOff`], fitted, agent): with an AT-2 (or any
//!   guided or seeker store) under threat Missiles, it runs in low and
//!   masked (200 ft above the ground) to 60% of the weapon's zone-1 range
//!   (about where the guided T bar stands), then unmasks: climbs 500 ft for
//!   at most 10 s while the shot comes up,
//!   fires, holds the line, and masks again turning away. It does not stop
//!   to hover: the AI's input-only adapter cannot hold a helicopter at a
//!   hover (asked for a low speed it settles nose-down into the ground), so
//!   the unmask is flown at speed, which also keeps the helicopter's speed
//!   for its defence (John, 2026-10-11).
//! - **Rockets** fly the pop-up's final like a fighter's rocket run: the cue
//!   is flown onto the pass's drawn aim point and up to eight leave at the
//!   record's cadence while it stays inside the skill circle.
//! - **The AT-2** leaves when the shared release test passes (the target in
//!   the launcher's 45 degree cone with a clear line), and the helicopter
//!   then holds its nose on the target until the missile has hit or is gone
//!   (the launcher sight rule: command guidance needs the target in the
//!   launcher's cone every tick).
//! - **Exit**: retail's is 5 degrees up at maximum speed straight ahead,
//!   levelling at the pass's height, to max(20,000 ft, 2R) from the target,
//!   then turn back and choose again. A helicopter flying it after a
//!   pop-up crossed the target area at 1,800 ft, where a site it had not
//!   seen shot an AH-64 down (slice HF1). T.O.R.E's helicopter leaves the
//!   target area instead, always, threat or not (opinionated, John
//!   2026-10-13: "the helicopter leaves after its run", and no straight-on
//!   exit even with no threat near; the shape is fitted, agent): it turns away from
//!   the target, round every ring it knows and the ambush ring of a threat
//!   that engaged it, and masks at 200 ft over the highest ground ahead at
//!   its strike speed, to the same distance, then turns back and chooses
//!   again.
//!
//! Defence, the safe test and going home are the fighters'.
