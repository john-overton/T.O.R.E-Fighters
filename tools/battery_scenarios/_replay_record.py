"""Recording scenarios: probes recorded, read back every way, damaged files rejected.

Each recording scenario runs one AI probe with `--record-mission` and
`--verify-render`, then reads the recording back with `--recording-info`,
`--recording-log`, `--recording-acmi` and `--recording-diff`, and checks every
file it wrote. Scenarios that ask for a repeat also run the probe twice more
(once recorded, once not) to prove that identical runs record identically and
that recording changes nothing the probe prints.
