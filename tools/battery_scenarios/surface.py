"""Lane: ai. Surface units: ground target resolution, layout and base-layout air defenses.

`surface-resolve-all` runs `--surface-dump --all`: every offered Quick Mission
ground target template of every theater resolved at every defense level with
three seeds, each theater's base layout, and each template placed in its
theater's scene at heavy defenses. It checks the counts against the retail
survey (template objects, `<sam>` and `<aaa>` slots, targets per template,
base-layout SAM and AAA by side), the 0, 25, 60 and 100 percent rolls, and that
a second run repeats every digest.

`surface-relocate-sweep` runs `--surface-dump --sweep`: every offered template
placed at heavy defenses with seeds 1 to 20. Every placement passes the site
rules, the anchored templates are exactly the expected ones and never move, at
least 60 percent of the other placements relocate, the batteries and trucks
keep their rules, each base layout forms its batteries, and a second run
repeats the digests.

`surface-class-sweep` runs `--surface-dump --classes`: the terrain class rule
(land units and structures on land, ships on water) over every offered
template placed at heavy defenses with seeds 1 to 20 and over each theater's
base layout. A unit the layout moved, a supply truck or a battery radar it
added must stand on its class; a unit still at its retail spot is the data's
and is not judged (docs/spec/surface-defenses.md, "Validity").

`surface-start-placement` runs `--surface-dump --starts`: one mission per
theater with a ground target and a 50 nm enemy distance. Red starts within
5 nm of the target; Blue starts 50 nm from Red toward its own side, heading
at the target; both on the map. See
docs/spec/surface-defenses.md.

`surface-area-sweep` runs `--surface-dump --area-sweep`: the enemy area
defenses of a Quick Mission with no ground target (B23) in every theater at
every strength with seeds 1 and 2. Every unit keeps the area rules (Red's side,
land, level, clear of layout objects and runways), every theater but the
Kurils (islands, mostly sea) stands every site, and a second run repeats the
digests. `surface-area-engage` flies past the first area site of a Ukraine
mission (heavy, seed 1, an SA-14) at 4,000 ft and expects it to launch.

`surface-grounding` (B13, 2026-10-12; slice GROUND, 2026-10-13) runs `--surface-dump
--grounding`, the grounding audit: every OT, NT and PT the import and the retail media hold, stood on flat
ground through the placement path and drawn through the scenery's own code (faces, the hit box, and a man's
sprites or cards at 300 ft and boosted at 6,000 ft). Everything but runways, bridges, roads and ships stands on the
bottom of its shape within 0.05 ft (the factory hall FACTD lifted 42.7 ft, the hangar 26.7 ft, the airfield
squad TROOPS 3.3 ft), that bottom agrees with the shape's F2 ground offset within 3 ft, and bridges, roads
and ships are not lifted.

`surface-small-arms-airfield` flies a 400 kt, 300 ft pass over an airfield target's squads (B17, BD2): one
squad at each experience, the squads around it at average and at ace, and a 1,000 ft, a 600 kt and a 1,500 ft
side pass. Their rounds carry tracers (every third round) and they only rarely hit a jet passing through
(about one round in a hundred; the riflemen lead it poorly, John 2026-10-12).

`surface-tank-aa` (John, 2026-10-24) puts one T-72 of Iraq's withdrawing column against aircraft: a helicopter
hovering 24 degrees above it is never taken and costs no round (the tank gun's 20 degree elevation), one hovering
low 0.5 km out draws its first round 4 s after the lock (the record's 1 s and the tank's 3 s lay on an aircraft),
every round at a 450 kt jet 200 ft over it leaves at 20 degrees or less, and a jet 2,500 ft over it draws none.

`surface-squad-killable` kills one airfield squad (BD2) with the A-4E's gun in a strafing pass, with an F/A-18's
Mk 82 in a dive, and with the trace's own kill at 23 s: every one is a kill of the squad's id, and a squad
killed in the middle of a pass fires no more.

`surface-flak-team` (nr-flak2, John 2026-10-14) runs `--flak-pass`, which flies a flight of two or four on a
scripted line over a team of heavy flak guns (KS-12 and KS-19 within a nautical mile of each other) or a lone
gun, every other armed unit laid down: North Vietnam's storage template, whose four guns form one team. A flight
of four heading in is engaged by the whole team (heading-in trigger), the shells spread over every member, the
lead lives, each gun's eight-shell opening barrage is 0.75 s a shell and spread round the flight, and every flak
knock is half the old one. Eight aircraft grazing the team's longest reach with one of them in range (under a
quarter) draw no fire; with two of them in range (a quarter) they are engaged; a four-ship grazing it with one
member in reach (a quarter, but under the minimum of two) draws none. Two players in seats heading in
both draw fire, and a lone KS-19 (a team of one) still fires at a flight.

The engagement scenarios run `--surface-trace`, which flies the player on a
scripted straight line past one surface unit and prints what its controller
does (phases, shots, bursts, radar, HARM rolls, battery changes), the RWR's
ground squares, locks and tone, decoy rolls and a summary line. They read the
retail records the import does not keep yet from the retail media, as the dump
does. Numbers they check are the record's and the AAA tuning table's
(docs/spec/surface-defenses.md).
