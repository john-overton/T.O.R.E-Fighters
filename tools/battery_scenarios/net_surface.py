"""Lane: net. A ground target online (protocol 22, slice N1), over real UDP on 127.0.0.1.

`net-surface-loopback`: a `tore-server` flies the dedicated server guide's mission with a ground target in
Ukraine, the moving column `~QUCOL` at heavy AAA and SAM defenses, the enemy 5 nm from the column, and two bots
fly it. The server draws the surface seed before it sends the mission; every bot builds the same surface (one
digest), draws the column's moving tanks and is told what the defenses do (radars, rails, damage, bursts or
launches).

`net-surface-pvp`: the same mission in PvP with one bot on each side. Redfor defends the target: the Blue bot's
debrief has the Destroy line, the Red bot's the Protect line; the template's radars never paint the Red bot. Blue's
capture converts into a format 3 replay with the ground target, its seed and the surface units named.

Both read the `tore-bot` surface line (`NAME: surface: digest D, moving M, ...`, every five seconds). See
docs/testing/lane-net.md.
