"""Lane: flight. The AI strike driver (AI strike round, slice ST-D;
`.local/ai-a2g/plan.md`, docs/testing/lane-flight.md "AI strike driver").

`--a2g-run THEATER STEM --pilot ai` lets the AI fly the striker and prints
`ai-strike:` lines (PROFILE, RELEASE, IMPACT miss_ft, KILL, EGRESS, LOST) from
what the simulation reports. Two kinds of scenario use it:

* Driver scenarios, which pass today and keep passing as the strike behaviour
  lands: they check that the driver runs, that its report is consistent with
  itself (the summary counts the lines, a release comes before its impact),
  that a human-flown run is handed to the AI, and that a wing order goes out.
  `ai-strike-driver`, `ai-strike-handback`, `ai-strike-order`; the order scenarios `ai-wing-ground-order`
  and `ai-wing-lase` (slice ST-O).
* Takeover (slice ST-K): `ai-strike-takeover`, a human's laser bomb pass in LVL continued by the AI
  after a handback and taken back afterwards.
* Behaviour scenarios, one per weapon class (slice ST-T, the strike tactics):
  `ai-strike-bombs`, `ai-strike-rockets`, `ai-strike-maverick`,
  `ai-strike-jdam`, `ai-sead-harm`, `ai-strike-defended`. Each run names the
  pass it flew, releases, and ends the round within its skill's limits; the
  unguided ones also print the pass's drawn aim offset on the RELEASE line,
  which must lie inside the release circle when the draw says so and in the
  ring R to 2R otherwise.

* Lasing scenarios (slice ST-L, docs/spec/ai-strike.md "Lasing"): `ai-strike-laser-self` (an F-16C's
  Pave Spike lases its own GBU-10 through the whole fall in an offset turn, then exits; an Su-25's
  built-in cone holds its nose on the target instead) and `ai-strike-laser-buddy` (an AI lases for
  a player's GBU-10; an AI F-14 with only a GBU-10 and no designator drops on a player's spot; the
  same F-14 with nobody lasing does not choose the bomb). The runs print `PHASE`, `HOLD` and
  `LASER` lines for them.
* The committed-to-release window (John, 2026-10-28): `ai-strike-commit-aaa`, gunfire inside the
  last 5 s of a straight Mk 82 pass waits for the release (`COMMIT ... held_defence=yes`), and the
  same pass with a gun moved out under the run line breaks into Defend before the window opens.

`parse_runs` reads the output; the check functions are tested in
tools/test_battery_ai_strike.py.
