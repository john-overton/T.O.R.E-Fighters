Stage D design of 2026-09-30, reviewed by John the same day. **Built (D7b, on
the host session of D7a):** the program: the options, the configuration file,
the import, `--check`, the start-up refusals, the real-time run loop, the
console, the status line and the log; on 127.0.0.1 a scripted client joins over
a real UDP socket, flies and leaves, and `quit` stops the server. **Built
(D8b):** the game joins one with `--connect` ([joining from the
game](#joining-from-the-game)). **Built (EF3):** a player's game hosts the
same host session itself with `--host` ([hosting from the
game](#hosting-from-the-game)). **Built (I3):** it lists itself on the
Internet Lobby when `broadcast` is on ([broadcasting](#broadcasting-on-the-internet-lobby)).
The dedicated server is part of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages)
and the [multiplayer guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#dedicated-servers). Fighters
Anthology had no dedicated server; everything on this page is an agent
proposal unless it is credited to John.

## What it is

`tore-server` is a separate program with no window, graphics or sound. It
runs one Quick Mission at a time at a fixed 120 ticks a second, never paused.
The AI flies every aircraft no human holds, and players join with the game and
take aircraft in flight. Each release publishes it for Linux, Windows and
macOS as its own download ([downloading it](#downloading-it)), and it builds
from the same workspace as the game:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked -p tore-server
```

It does not link the game's windowing, graphics or audio libraries, so it
starts on a machine without a display or a sound system.

The server simulates the flight models, terrain and weapons from the retail
data, so it needs its operator's own copy of Fighters Anthology, imported the
same way the game imports it. Nothing derived from retail media is ever sent
over the network: every player's game reads its own import, and the server
checks that the two agree ([content check](#joining-from-the-game)).

## Downloading it

Since v0.2.0 every release publishes the server beside the game's packages on
the [releases page](https://github.com/john-overton/T.O.R.E-Fighters/releases),
as an archive of its own: an operator does not need the game installed.
*Agent decision (2026-10-22):* a separate archive rather than a copy inside the
game's packages, so a headless machine downloads only the server and nothing
that opens a window.

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Windows, 64-bit | `tore-server-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip` |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | `tore-server-<version>-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS, Intel | `tore-server-<version>-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Linux, 64-bit Intel/AMD | `tore-server-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |

Each has a `.sha256` file beside it. The archive holds one folder, named like
the archive, with:

- `tore-server` (`tore-server.exe` on Windows), the server;
- `server.conf`, a [configuration file](#the-configuration-file) holding the
  defaults with a comment on each, to edit;
- `mission.txt`, a [mission file](#the-mission-file): two friendly wings
  against two enemy wings over Ukraine;
- `DEDICATED-SERVER.md` (this guide), `LICENSE` and
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

No retail data is in it. Unpack it anywhere, [import](#importing-the-game) your
own Fighters Anthology once (not needed on a machine where the game has
already imported it: the server reads the game's data folder by default), then
start it from that folder:

```sh
curl -LO https://github.com/john-overton/T.O.R.E-Fighters/releases/download/v0.2.1/tore-server-0.2.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
curl -LO https://github.com/john-overton/T.O.R.E-Fighters/releases/download/v0.2.1/tore-server-0.2.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256
sha256sum -c tore-server-0.2.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256
tar -xzf tore-server-0.2.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd tore-server-0.2.1-linux-x86_64
./tore-server --import /path/to/FIGHTERS
./tore-server --config server.conf --check
./tore-server --config server.conf
```

(`v0.2.1` stands for the release you want; on macOS, `shasum -a 256 -c` checks
the file.) On Windows, unzip it and run the three `tore-server` lines in PowerShell or
a Command Prompt, as `.\tore-server.exe`; `Get-FileHash` prints the SHA-256 to
compare with the `.sha256` file. Then see
[ports and firewalls](#ports-and-firewalls) to let players in.

There is no developer signing or notarization, as with the game
([first launch](DEVELOPMENT.md#unsigned-builds-and-first-launch)):

- **Linux.** Built on Ubuntu 22.04 and checked not to need a newer C library
  than its glibc 2.35, so it runs on Ubuntu 22.04 or later and other
  distributions of that age or newer.
- **macOS.** The binary is ad-hoc signed for integrity, without Developer ID
  or notarization. A browser download is quarantined and may be blocked
  ("cannot be verified"). Try running it from the unpacked folder, then if
  blocked choose **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway** and
  run it again. Recent macOS no longer has the right-click Open bypass. For a
  trusted project download that remains blocked, run
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine tore-server` in that folder and retry. A
  download made with `curl` is not quarantined. Needs macOS 11 or later, as
  the game does.
- **Windows.** A zip a browser downloaded is marked as coming from the
  internet, and Windows may warn before the server first runs. Before
  unzipping, open the zip's Properties and tick **Unblock** (or run
  `Unblock-File` on it in PowerShell). The first run asks whether the program
  may accept connections; allow it.

There is no 32-bit Windows or ARM Linux download; build it from source there.
A workflow run that is not a tag (a `release-test/...` branch, or a manual
run) builds the same archives as the `server-<runner>` artifacts without
publishing them ([packaging](DEVELOPMENT.md#packaging)).

## Importing the game

```sh
tore-server --import /path/to/FIGHTERS
```

The path is an installed Fighters Anthology folder or a disc folder (the one
holding `SETUP.ESA`), exactly as the game's first-run import accepts, from the
1.0 disc build or the 1.02F patch ([first-run import](spec/first-run-import.md)).
It writes the import into the data folder and prints where its report is. The
import is the same code the game runs, moved into the `tore-import` library.

The data folder is the game's own by default (`TORE_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir`
changes it), so on a machine that already has the game imported the server
needs no import at all. Loading prunes older import generations in that folder,
as the game does ([import cache](spec/import-cache.md)).

The server keeps each theater's city fill layout in `city-cache/` in the data
folder, shared with the game, so after the first start on a theater the city
loads in a fraction of a second instead of up to about two seconds. The files
are disposable: delete the folder at any time, or set `TORE_CITY_CACHE=0` to
skip it ([layout cache](ARCHITECTURE.md#exploratory-vegetation-rendering)).

## Running it

```sh
tore-server --config server.conf
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--config FILE` | The [configuration file](#the-configuration-file); default `server.conf` in the data folder |
| `--data-dir DIR` | The data folder holding the import and the logs |
| `--import FOLDER` | Import the game, then exit |
| `--port N`, `--mission FILE` | Override those two settings of the configuration file |
| `--check` | Validate the configuration and import; with rotation, build every entry and report its summary/settings. Print the selected mission's aircraft, runways, manifest and import content. Exit without opening the port |
| `--ai-observe-hz N`, `--ai-lean-sensors [on\|off]` | AI test settings (slices S7b and S9), for measuring and trying, not for play: `N` is how often AI aircraft observe, 120, 60 (default since optimization round 2), 40, 30 or 20, staggered across ticks, and lean sensors (on by default; a bare flag means on, `off` runs the full sensors) have AI aircraft skip the visual channel and build the received-radar list only when a warning needs it, which decides exactly as full ones do. The server's setting governs the simulation and no player is told; a server running another rate or full sensors appoints no standby. See [AI test settings](ARCHITECTURE.md#ai-test-settings-observation-rate-and-lean-sensors) |
| `--help`, `--version` | Print the options, or the version, compatibility code and commit for the selected data profile, and exit |

*Built (D7b).* *Agent decisions:* with no `server.conf` in the data folder the
defaults apply (a configuration file named with `--config` must exist); a
`--mission` path is taken against the current folder, like any command-line
path, where the configuration file's own `mission` is taken against the
configuration file; `--check` also reads the configuration file, since the
mission path and `open-planes` come from it, and it builds the mission once,
which is what catches a mission the import cannot fly. `--import` prints its
progress as the game's first-run screen shows it and ends with the path of
`import-report.txt`. `--check` prints each plane as its number, aircraft,
wing, place in the wing and skill, each runway as its number, airport name and
length (a STOL strip is marked `STOL`; it is a ground start like any other since 2026-10-11), and the manifest's
resource count and 64-bit digest. A mission that cannot be built is refused
with the builder's own words, for example "Selected runway is unavailable".

*Built (L3, 2026-10-05).* `--check` then prints the import's content
([compatibility](ARCHITECTURE.md#compatibility)): where the import came from,
its counts and one line per item with its kind, key and digest, so an
operator can compare two imports line by line (`tore-bot --content-report`
prints the same lines for any data folder):

```text
Content: Fighters Anthology 1.02F, imported by T.O.R.E 0.1.4 (48d62dac)
Content items: 14 aircraft, 16 theaters, 131 weapons, the shared data
  aircraft A4E.PT 3f0c9a2e7d61b845
  ...
  shared data 9b17e2c04d5a6f38
```

An import made before stage L has no record of its source in the pack; the
server reads its Fighters Anthology build from the `FA.EXE:` line of
`import-report.txt` beside the pack, and the importer is unknown
("imported by an unknown T.O.R.E"). No re-import is needed.

At start it prints the version, commit and compatibility code, the data folder, a summary of the
mission, the port it listens on, whether it broadcasts on the Internet Lobby
(`Broadcast: off ...` or `Broadcast: on, to the Internet Lobby at ...`) and
"Waiting for players". It refuses to start,
with a plain message, when the import is missing or stale, the mission names
an aircraft, theater or runway the import does not have, a setting is unknown
or out of range, or the retail stall-speed switch (`--retail-stall-speeds` or
`TORE_RETAIL_STALL_SPEEDS`) is on, since every machine in a session must fly one
configuration.

## The configuration file

One setting per line, a name and a value, `#` to the end of the line is a
comment, as in the game's preference files. An unknown name is refused at
start, so a typo never passes silently.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `T.O.R.E server` | Shown to joining players, and in the server browser once it exists (stage I) |
| `port` | `26900` | The UDP port |
| `address` | `any` | The local address to listen on; `any` listens on every IPv4 and IPv6 address the machine has |
| `password` | none | A password players must give. It crosses the network as plain text |
| `max-players` | `30` | 1 to 30 (John's default, 2026-09-28); a co-op mission seats at most its 15 friendly planes |
| `rotation` | none | Rotation file, relative to this configuration file. Mutually exclusive with an explicit `mission` or `--mission`; see [map rotation](#map-rotation) |
| `mission` | `mission.txt` | The [mission file](#the-mission-file), relative to the configuration file |
| `open-planes` | `friendly` | Which planes humans may take: `friendly` (the mode's planes: the friendly ones in co-op, every plane with `mode pvp`), `all` or a list of plane numbers. A listed plane opens its whole lineage: a revival's or the AI's respawn of it is open too |
| `snapshot-rate` | `60` | Snapshots a second to each player: 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40 or 60 (John, 2026-10-06; 30 before). Aircraft far from a player update 4 times a second at most. Halving it roughly halves the server's upload ([performance](#performance)). It is the server's own: the lobby shows it and the King cannot turn it (a game a player hosts has the King's lobby setting of 60, 30 or 20 instead, slice R1) |
| `start` | `first-player` | `first-player`: the lobby waits, the mission not flying, until the first player holding a slot is ready; `now`: it flies from the start ([the lobby](#the-lobby)) |
| `time-limit` | `0` | Minutes after which the mission ends; 0 for none. The [mission countdown](spec/hud-layout.md#mission-countdown) appears in Escape and during the final five minutes in flight, using this rotation entry's limit. The King's own time limit (below) replaces it until the server goes back to its file |
| `empty-timeout` | `60` | Seconds the mission keeps flying after the last player leaves, before it ends |
| `after-end` | `restart` | Repeat the mission, or quit. With rotation, continue the sequence, or quit after one cycle |
| `restart-delay` | `30` | Seconds between a mission's end and the next start |
| `status-interval` | `10` | Seconds between status lines; 0 for none |
| `broadcast` | `off` | `on` lists the server on the Internet Lobby, so players find it there ([broadcasting](#broadcasting-on-the-internet-lobby)); `off` keeps it private: players join by address or find it on their local network (John, 2026-10-05, as OpenRA's servers do) |
| `master` | the public master | The master server the server broadcasts to, `HOST` or `HOST:PORT` (port 26901 when none is given) |
| `telemetry` | `on` | While broadcasting, send the master anonymous statistics at the end of each mission (John, 2026-10-05: on by default); `off` sends none |
| `port-mapping` | `off` | `on` asks the router to forward the game port when the server starts, by UPnP, NAT-PMP or PCP, and removes it when the server stops ([ports](#ports-and-firewalls)). Off by default, since a server's port is normally forwarded by its owner |
| `king` | `none` | `first-player`: the first player to join wears the crown, and when the King leaves the longest-connected player does; the King changes the mission and the settings below, locks slots, starts, ends, kicks and passes the crown ([the King](#the-kings-settings-and-a-king)). `none` (John, 2026-10-05: the default): nobody is King |
| `king-mission` | `open` | `locked`: the King may not change the mission or the settings; start, kick, slot locks and the crown still work. The lobby tells every player, so the King's Mission... opens read only with "This server's mission is fixed." (protocol 20). Needs `king first-player` |

The King's settings ([architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-kings-settings)) take
the same names in the file, so a server without a King can still run a PvP game
or a delayed observer. Each value is one of the setting's words or a number:

| Setting | Default (co-op, PvP) | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `co-op` | `co-op` (humans fly for the friendly side) or `pvp` (for either side); `pvp` changes the defaults of the settings below to PvP's |
| `join-in-progress` | `on` | `off` refuses every seating once the mission has flown its first tick |
| `visibility` | `local` | `local` answers the local network's search, `hidden` does not; a server lists itself on the Internet Lobby only with `broadcast on`, so `public` is refused |
| `friendly-fire` | `on` | `off`: no round damages an aircraft of its shooter's side |
| `lock-sides` | `off`, `on` | PvP only (refused in co-op). `off` lets players choose and change side; `on` (locked once flown) keeps each player on the side of the first plane it flew in a mission; `balanced` (Autobalance, John 2026-10-09) has the host seat each player on the side with fewer humans, refuses the players' own choice of side and keeps the sides fixed in flight ([the rule](ARCHITECTURE.md#autobalance-as-built-a1)). The lobby calls the setting Sides |
| `loadouts` | `own` | `any` allows the loadout page's Cheat loading |
| `respawn` | `none`, `revive` | `none`, `ai-slot` or `revive` |
| `lives` | `unlimited` | 0 to 10 or `unlimited` |
| `revive-delay` | `0` | Minutes: 0 to 5 (`none` is 0) |
| `revive-distance` | `10` | Nautical miles: 1, 5, 10, 20 or 40 (retail's), or 50, 75, 100 or 150 (John, 2026-10-09) |
| `revive-weapons` | `missiles` | `missiles`, `no-missiles`, `guns` or `half-guns` |
| `fight` | `sides` | PvP only: `sides` or `free-for-all` |
| `tally` | `kills` | PvP only: `kills`, `damage` or `ratio` |
| `kill-limit` | `none`, `5` | PvP only: `none`, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or 10 |
| `kill-owner` | `side` | PvP only: `total`, `side` or `player` |
| `observer-delay` | `0` | PvP only, seconds: 0 (`none`), 10, 30 or 60 |
| `ai` | `on` | `on` or `off`. Off disables AI aircraft, AI respawn and idle handoff. Unfilled slots stay empty; the same ready-player minimum and Force Start rules apply as with AI on. Ground defenses remain. |
| `min-players` | AI on: `0`; AI off: PvP `2`, co-op `1` | 0 (`none`) to `max-players`: starts require this many ready slot holders. Set in the server file or rotation, or by a King with `king-mission open`. See [minimum players](#minimum-players). |
| `ai-respawn` | `on` | `off` or `on`: whether a lost AI aircraft comes back under the revival rules (`lives`, counted per original aircraft, and `revive-delay`), at its flight's original spawn point, as a wingman of its flight. No effect while `respawn` is `none` (John, 2026-10-09). The log has a line for each AI loss and respawn |
| `idle-ai` | `5` | Minutes a player's game is away before the AI flies its aircraft: `never`, 1, 2, 5 or 10 (written in minutes, as `time-limit` is; John, 2026-10-06, slice F2-O4) |

The player limit, the password and the time limit are the settings
`max-players`, `password` and `time-limit` above.

*Built (D7b).* A name that appears twice is refused too, and a setting with no
value. A comment runs from the first `#`, so a password cannot contain one.
*Agent decisions for the ranges the table leaves open:* `name` is 1 to 60
printable characters, `password` at most 255 bytes (the wire's string limit),
`address` is `any` or an IP address (not a host name), `open-planes` lists plane
numbers 0 to 29 separated by spaces or commas (and each must exist in the
mission, which start-up checks), `time-limit` is at most 10,080 minutes (a
week), `empty-timeout` at most 86,400 seconds, and `restart-delay` and
`status-interval` at most 3,600 seconds.

*Built (F2-1), agent decisions:* a setting that applies only in PvP (`fight`,
`tally`, `kill-limit`, `kill-owner`, `observer-delay`) is refused without
`mode pvp` ("line 7: `kill-limit` applies only in PvP: add `mode pvp`, or leave
it out"), since a co-op server would never use it; `revive-delay` is written
in minutes, as `time-limit` is, and every other number in the unit the table
gives; a value off its list is refused with the list ("`kill-limit` must be
none, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or 10, not `4`"). The file's time limit may be any whole
minute up to a week, while a King picks from the lobby's list (none, 1, 5,
10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes).

## The mission file

A Quick Mission written as text: the same fields the Quick Mission creator
sets, with names instead of list positions, so a file works on any import.
It is the text form of `MissionSpec` ([architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#a-mission-with-no-window)),
the same text the server sends every joining player. The reader is
`MissionSpec::from_text` in `tore-world`, and a test parses the example below
straight out of this guide, so the two stay in step.

```text
tore-mission 1
theater UKR
condition clear
start airborne 20000
separation-nm 20
preset free
guns-only no
wing friendly 1 F18.PT 4 experienced
wing friendly 2 F14.PT 2 average
wing-choice friendly 2
wing enemy 1 MIG29.PT 4 experienced
wing enemy 2 SU27.PT 2 ace
survive friendly 2 yes
objective enemy 2 intercept friendly 1
cheats none
```

One `key value` line each; everything after a `#` is a comment and blank
lines do not count. An error names its line, for example `line 4: `MOON` is not
a theater`. An unknown key, theater, aircraft, skill, name or out-of-range
value is refused, so a typo never passes silently; so is a line that appears
twice.

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tore-mission 1` | The file's version; always first |
| `theater CODE` | Required. One of the sixteen theater codes the creator offers: `BAL`, `CUB`, `EGY`, `LFA`, `FRA`, `GRE`, `IRA`, `KURILE`, `TVIET`, `SPA`, `APA`, `PGU`, `NSK`, `WTA`, `UKR`, `VLA` |
| `condition NAME` | `clear` (the default), `cloudy`, `foggy`, `dawn`, `sunset` or `night`: the weather, the clock and the cloud deck the creator's choice sets |
| `time-of-day HH:MM`, `wind HEADING FEET-PER-SECOND`, `cloud-deck FEET` | Optional weather overrides of the condition's own, as the game's `TORE_WEATHER_TIME`, `TORE_WIND` and `TORE_CLOUD_ALTITUDE` set them: the wind is written as they write it, a heading of -360 to 360 degrees and a speed of 0 to 200 feet a second, and the cloud deck is 0 to 400,000 feet |
| `start airborne FEET` | 5,000 (the default), 10,000, 20,000 or 40,000 ft, the creator's choices |
| `start ground RUNWAY [FEET]` | A ground start from a runway object, by its number in the theater's layout (the object's id is 1,073,741,824 plus it; `--check` lists the theater's runways by number and airport name). The optional altitude is the creator's altitude setting, which a ground start keeps for its airborne aircraft to clear the ground (5,000 by default). A ground start needs the hybrid flight model for humans |
| `start ground auto [FEET]` | A ground start whose runway the world picks from the ground target (below), the creator's default when a target is set and no airport was named. Until the surface layout places starts from the target, the world takes the first friendly airport whose runway holds the wing. Needs the hybrid flight model for humans, as any ground start does |
| `enemy-start ground RUNWAY` or `enemy-start ground auto` | Enemy Wing 1, the Redfor flight, starts parked on that runway (a Redfor or neutral field's; `--check` marks Redfor fields `enemy: enemy-start ground only`), or on the Red-side field nearest the ground target at least 15 nm from it with `auto` (without a target, the first Red-side runway that holds the wing). The other enemy wings start in the air. Needs `wing enemy 1` with aircraft and a runway other than `start ground`'s. Absent (or `enemy-start airborne`) means airborne, where the layout puts the enemy |
| `ground-target TEMPLATE` | The creator's friendly ground target (its field 30), by the name of its template mission, for example `QUCOL` (the Ukraine armored column). It must be one of the theater's targets, listed in [the Quick Mission template reference](formats/quick-templates.md#recorded-facts-from-faexe-102f); the "nothing" entry of each theater is no target, so leave the line out. Absent means no ground target |
| `defenses aaa LEVEL sam LEVEL` | How heavily the target's anti-aircraft guns and SAM sites are manned (the creator's fields 31 and 32): `none`, `light`, `moderate` or `heavy`, which the creator words "not", "lightly", "moderately" and "heavily" and which man 0, 25, 60 and 100 percent of the template's slots. Without a `ground-target` they set the enemy's area defenses instead: SAM sites and guns scattered over Red's side of the front ([area defenses](spec/surface-defenses.md#area-defenses)); absent means none of either |
| `surface-seed N` | The whole number the target's layout is rolled from (which slots are manned, which units stand there, where). Absent or 0 means none drawn: the host draws one when the flight starts, and `--check` builds only a seed-0 preview. A layout that leaves a vehicle with no valid placement is refused, not flown with the vehicle misplaced or removed (see [vehicle footing](spec/surface-defenses.md#jitter)); a drawn seed can hit such a layout even when the preview passed, so a server that must start reliably names a nonzero seed that `--check` accepts. The creator, a King's lobby creator included, sends the seed it checked, and a restart keeps it |
| `enemy-nationality N` | The enemy's nationality, 0 to 59, an index into the creator's list (its field 20); it picks which equipment the target's units are drawn from. Absent means the theater's own enemy, as the creator gives it |
| `separation-nm N` | 1, 2, 5 (the default), 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300, the creator's choices. The distance must fit the theater, the ground target and its seed, and the wings: if the enemy cannot start the full distance away inside the map, the mission is refused with "Separation N nm does not fit this setup" by `--check`, at startup, for a rotation entry and for a King's mission. It is never shortened. Which distances fit is measured, not fixed per theater: 300 fits some targets in the Kurile and Baltic theaters, and 200 does not fit the Vietnam theater without a target. With a ground target and `start ground`, the template places the enemy and the line has no effect ([keeping the enemy on the map](spec/quick-mission-menu.md#keeping-the-enemy-on-the-map)) |
| `preset NAME` | The AI's standing orders: `free` (the default), `cap`, `intercept`, `escort`, `self-defense` or `hold` |
| `guns-only yes/no` | The creator's air combat setting; `no` by default. With the standard load it leaves the guns loaded and unloads the missiles |
| `wing SIDE N AIRCRAFT COUNT SKILL` | Up to three wings a side; `wing friendly 1` is required. The aircraft is its exact identity, one of `F18.PT` (the F/A-18D), `RAFALE.PT` (the Rafale C), `F14.PT`, `A4E.PT`, `F31.PT` (the X-31), `MIG29.PT`, `SU27.PT`, `MIG21.PT`, `SU25.PT`, `MIG23.PT`, `SU35.PT`, `F22.PT`, `F22N.PT` (the F-22N) or `faxx` (the F/A-XX); skills are `novice`, `average`, `experienced`, `ace` or `dummy`. Friendly wing 1 holds 1 to 5 aircraft, the others 0 to 5. A wing with no line has no aircraft. Fixed wings and Player Choice AI defaults must use a type accepted by the AI-flyable catalog. Human Choice overrides may use any flyable type shared by the session |
| `wing-choice SIDE N` | Makes that wing Player Choice. Its existing `wing` aircraft is the mandatory AI default, including with AI off. Human picks are separate. |
| `plane-aircraft PLANE AIRCRAFT` | A human aircraft override for an existing Player Choice slot, numbered from zero. Duplicate, missing and fixed-aircraft slots are refused. |
| `objective SIDE N NAME [SIDE N]` | A wing's objective: `inherit` (the default, the preset), `free`, `cap`, `intercept` or `escort` another wing (an enemy wing for `intercept`, another wing of its own side for `escort`), `self-defense`, `hold` |
| `survive SIDE N yes/no` | The wing must survive; `no` by default |
| `cheats LIST` | `none` (the default), or a list of the game's cheats: `unlimited-ammo`, `unlimited-fuel`, `no-spins`, `no-turbulence`, `extra-g`, `ignore-weapon-weights`, `no-sun-whiteout`, `no-g-effects`, `no-screen-shake`, `no-crashes`, `easy-aiming`, `ignore-midair-collisions`, `easy-targeting`, `guns-only`, `easy-physics`, `damage=invulnerable`, `damage=realistic` and `enemy-ai=LEVEL` (`novice`, `average`, `experienced` or `ace`); they apply to every player |
| `flight-model human hybrid/legacy`, `flight-model ai standard/hybrid` | The flight models: the hybrid model for humans (the default, and the only one a networked mission uses) and `hybrid` for every AI aircraft (the default here). `legacy` and `standard` are the single-player game's own settings |
| `enemy-skill novice/average/none` | The game's `--enemy-skill`: every enemy wing at one level. `none` by default |
| `fixture-wings yes/no` | The game's `--fixture-wings` development setting: straight-flight fixtures instead of AI wings. A server does not use it |
| `loadout fuel POUNDS`, `loadout cheat yes/no`, `loadout station N WEAPON COUNT QUANTITY` | The loadout of plane 0 for a single-player start, as the creator's Load Ordnance page leaves it: the fuel, the loadout screen's Cheat, and one line for every station, in the aircraft's station order, naming its weapon's resource, its capacity and what it carries. **Used only by single player**: an open (networked) mission refuses it, since nobody flies from the start |
| `friendly-fire on/off`, `loadouts own/any` | A networked mission's two settings that its build needs (*built, F2-1*): `friendly-fire off` spares every aircraft its own side's rounds, `loadouts any` allows Cheat loadings. The host writes them from its settings into the mission it sends, so a server's own `friendly-fire` and `loadouts` settings decide them and the mission file leaves them out; single player refuses both |
| `share-flight-loadout yes/no` | QMC single-player same-wing sharing, off when omitted in an authored mission. Multiplayer expands human choices into per-plane loads, preserving explicit AI loads. See [load sharing](spec/multiplayer.md#human-flight-loadouts). |
| `plane-loadout PLANE fuel POUNDS`, `plane-loadout PLANE cheat no`, `plane-loadout PLANE station N WEAPON COUNT QUANTITY` | The loadout a player chose in the lobby for one plane of a networked mission, the same lines as `loadout` with the plane number first. *Built (EF4).* The host writes them into the mission it sends when a flight starts, so every player builds the same aircraft; a server's own file normally leaves them out, and a plane with none carries its aircraft's standard load. Each is checked as the [lobby's loadout rule](#the-lobby) says, and single player refuses them |

When a player takes a Choice slot, the log identifies the accepted type:
`Viper took plane 6 (Player choice): F-16C`. Late Choice joins replace the AI
cleanly at revival placement. Departures return to the wing AI default under
`ai-respawn`, at the original spawn; a dropped player's Choice aircraft is kept
for it, flown by the AI, like any other. With `ai off`, no AI replacement appears.


*Status of the ground target lines:* they are read, checked against the
theater's targets, carried to every player and shown in the lobby's creator.
The world builds the targets, defenses and both sides' starts under the
[surface defenses spec](spec/surface-defenses.md#start-placement).

`--check` reports every aircraft's nearest hostile AAA or SAM unit in
horizontal nautical miles (6,076.12 ft). `Defense start` includes base-layout,
target and area defenses; `Mission defense start` excludes base-layout units.
Friendly and neutral defenses never count. The latter lets operators check
a co-op target/area clearance rule separately from existing airfield cover.
With rotation it prints these measurements for every entry.
These are initial positions, not a promise about flight paths or revivals.
Use a nonzero `surface-seed` to keep the measured layout in live rounds;
otherwise the host draws a new seed at flight start, and a drawn layout that
cannot place every vehicle is refused (at startup the server then does not start). A large `separation-nm`
alone proves nothing about clearance: Red airborne starts are by the target,
and airfields can have their own defenses. Player Choice aircraft or loadouts
that alter ground parking need a fresh check of the actual selected mission.

Planes are numbered as in the game: plane 0 is the lead of friendly wing 1,
then every other aircraft in wing order. `--check` prints the list. Every
plane carries its aircraft's standard load unless a player chose another for
it in the lobby, and a player who takes a plane in flight keeps the load of
the plane they take. Every AI
aircraft flies the hybrid flight model in a networked mission (John,
2026-09-28). Until the stage F lobby lets the creator save one, mission files
are written by hand.

Writing a spec back out (`MissionSpec::to_text`) gives the same lines in this
order, leaving out the ones at their default, and reading that text gives the
same spec. *Agent decisions:* the wind line writes the game's units rather than
knots so nothing is rounded; the optional altitude on a ground start, the flight
model, enemy skill, fixture wings and loadout lines are the parser's additions
for the game's own use of the same text.

## Map rotation

*Opinionated, requested by John on 2026-10-16.* Set `rotation rotation.txt`
in `server.conf` to run a sequence of missions. With neither `rotation` nor
`mission`, the existing `mission.txt` default applies. **The lead chose the
strict line format below**, matching `server.conf`, instead of adding a JSON
parser. John asked for “json or something”, not specifically this syntax.

This full example is parsed directly by a unit test:

```text
tore-rotation 1
order in-order          # or shuffle
mission pvp-ukr.txt
  mode pvp
  time-limit 20
  kill-limit 10
mission coop-baltic.txt
  mode co-op
  respawn none
mission pvp-ukr.txt
  mode pvp
  fight free-for-all
```

The version line comes first. `order` is optional (default `in-order`), once,
before the first mission. Each `mission FILE` starts an entry; paths are relative
to the rotation file. Spaces in paths are allowed, quotes are not needed.
Comments start with `#`. Indentation is optional. A file may appear more than
once with different settings. Unknown names, missing values, duplicate settings
within an entry, and misplaced lines are refused with the file and line number.
At least one entry is required.

Each entry inherits the explicit `server.conf` values, then overrides them.
The **mission-scoped settings** are the King's table above except `visibility`,
plus `time-limit`: `mode`, `join-in-progress`, `friendly-fire`, `lock-sides`,
`loadouts`, `respawn`, `lives`, `revive-delay`, `revive-distance`, `revive-weapons`,
`fight`, `tally`, `kill-limit`, `kill-owner`, `observer-delay`, `ai-respawn`,
`idle-ai`, `ai`, and `min-players`. An entry may use `ai off` or its own
`min-players`; the next entry inherits the server value again. New mission settings use the same shared registry and validation.
Server-wide settings, including name, port, address, password, player capacity,
visibility, broadcast, master, telemetry, port mapping, snapshot rate, King,
start rule, restart delay and empty timeout, are refused inside entries.
PvP-only settings require `mode pvp` in the effective configuration. For example,
an entry changing an explicitly configured PvP server to co-op must not inherit
explicit PvP-only settings. Mode defaults fill values neither file sets.

`--check` builds every entry once, prints every summary and its effective
mission settings that differ from the co-op defaults, and fails if any entry
cannot parse or build. It also prints the selected mission's detailed plane,
runway and content report. It opens no port. Normal startup validates the whole
rotation as well. Mission files are read again at each boundary. If an entry
then cannot be read or built, it is logged and skipped. If every candidate
fails, the server logs that fact and stops.

Every normal mission end, including time limit, kill limit, empty timeout,
the King ending the mission, and console `end`, advances after `restart-delay`.
Players keep their connections and debriefs. The new mission clears slots,
loadouts, ready marks, side assignments and slot locks. Its mission and settings
reach the lobby and Internet Lobby through the existing update paths.
At the end, players and the console receive `Next mission: <summary>` using the
existing notice message. A later failed build can change that announced choice.
Start logs include `Rotation: N missions, in order` (or `shuffle`) and each
selected mission logs `Rotation 2/5: <summary>`. Status adds `rotation 2/5`.

*Agent decisions:* `after-end restart` continues indefinitely. `after-end quit`
stops at the end of one cycle, after the final restart delay. Queued debriefs
get the existing acknowledgement grace, at most another five seconds. Shuffle draws a
fresh permutation each cycle and avoids repeating an entry across the boundary
when there are at least two. Repeated file paths are distinct entries; the
shuffle also separates repeated paths where possible. A one-entry list repeats.
A King's mission change with `king first-player` and `king-mission open`
replaces only the current round; the next rotation entry still follows it.
`king-mission locked` keeps its existing restrictions.

`next` ends with debriefs and advances after the delay. `goto N` selects a
one-based file entry for that boundary; subsequent rounds continue from its
position in the current cycle. `restart` repeats the current rotation entry
immediately. `reload` parses and trial-builds the entire new file before accepting
it; any error keeps the old rotation. An accepted reload starts a fresh cycle
at the next boundary, taking precedence over a pending `goto`. It uses the
original `server.conf` values; it does not reread `server.conf`.

```

- **Lobby.** With `start first-player` the mission is built but does not
  fly until the first player holding a slot is ready, so the first player
  starts it the way a single player starts a Quick Mission
  ([the lobby](#the-lobby)). With [`min-players`](#minimum-players) N it waits
  for N ready players, and again at each restart or rotation entry. No
  snapshots are sent while it waits.
- **Flying.** Players join and take free planes in flight and leave at any
  time. A player who leaves, or whose game goes silent for 5 seconds, gives
  the plane back to the AI at once; it is not held for a rejoin until stage K.
  *Since EF-K* a game that is still running but whose loop is held up (a
  window dragged on Windows, a long frame, a screenshot, or since slice NET
  a mission build on a slow machine as it joins) is not silent: a
  small thread of the game sends a
  [keepalive](formats/net-protocol.md#keepalive) once a second for up to a
  minute, and the player keeps the plane, which flies on with its last
  controls for half a second and then with a paused game's neutral controls
  (stick centred, throttle where it was, trigger released) until the game is
  back. The log shows the stall when the first keepalive arrives and its end
  when the game is back:

  ```text
  seat 2 Viper: game stalled, flying neutral
  seat 2 Viper: game back after 7.4 s
  ```

  (a player in the lobby shows as `Viper: game stalled`), and the player's
  once-a-minute figures count the ticks repeated, 120 for each second of it;
  a stall shorter than about a second sends no keepalive and logs nothing.
  A game stalled for longer than a minute leaves with the usual "silent" line
  about 65 seconds after it stopped
  ([details](ARCHITECTURE.md#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)).
  *Since protocol 28 (slice NET2)* the server's own mission builds (a
  King's change of the mission or of friendly fire or the loadout rule, a
  flight starting with the players' loadouts, the next mission after an
  end) keep every player too: a thread sends each a loading keepalive twice
  a second for up to 3 minutes, so nobody is dropped and no standby takes
  over while it builds. A build long enough for it logs one line:

  ```text
  loaded the mission in 15.0 s; 3 players kept through it (30 rounds of loading keepalives)
  ```

  A destroyed plane stays destroyed; respawns are stage F.
- **Ending.** The mission ends at the time limit, once the last player has been
  out of the flight for the empty timeout, or on the console's `end`. Every
  player gets "Mission ended" first and every seated player then its own
  debrief. *Since EF4* the players stay connected, back in the lobby with their
  slots and loadouts and their ready marks cleared, for the next mission; a
  join while the mission is ended is refused as shutting down, with the
  seconds to the next one. A player who ends the mission on their side gets
  their debrief at once, is back in the lobby, and the mission flies on for
  the others.
- **Next.** With rotation, the [next entry](#map-rotation) loads. Without it,
  after the restart delay the same mission starts again from its
  file, fresh, back in the lobby (or flying, with `start now`), or the server
  exits. With `after-end quit` every player is disconnected with the text
  "server stopping" once its messages are acknowledged, and the host stops
  once they are gone, or 5 seconds after the end.

*Built (D7a, D7b), the host's settled rules:* the number of players a mission
seats is the lesser of `max-players` and the planes open to humans (the status
line's `players 2/15`); the empty timeout counts from the moment the last
seated player leaves (sends Leave or is dropped), not from the mission's start;
`end` and `restart` tell the players "ended by the server"; `quit` disconnects
everyone at once with "server stopping" and sends no debriefs. If a tick or the
rebuild for the next mission fails, the host logs the fault, and ends the
mission (or stops, when the rebuild itself failed).

## The lobby

*Built (EF4).* Before each mission flies, and again after it, the server is in
its lobby: players are connected but not flying, take slots, choose their
loadouts and mark ready, and every player is sent the lobby's state whenever
it changes. The design is the architecture's
[lobby](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-lobby); a game a player hosts has a King, a
dedicated server has none. *The dedicated server's rules, agent decisions:*

- **The mission** is the mission file's, always: nobody can change it, and
  every player's **Mission...** button shows it read only (the lobby pass,
  John 2026-10-09). A player whose import cannot play it is told why and stays connected in the
  lobby, marked unable, and cannot take a slot.
- **Slots** are the planes `open-planes` opens (every friendly plane by
  default, every plane with `mode pvp`), one player a slot, held from the lobby across missions until the
  player leaves it or the game. A player holding a slot may send a loadout
  for it, which the host checks by the single-player Load Ordnance page's
  rule (each store within its station's capacity, only weapons that fly,
  fuel within the tanks, weight within the maximum take-off weight, nothing
  but the gun with the mission's Guns only; cheat loading is refused) and
  refuses with that rule's words; a plane with none flies its standard load.
- **`start first-player`**: the mission starts flying when the first player
  holding a slot marks ready, with every ready slot holder in its plane at
  the first tick. Players who get ready later, or join later, take their
  slot's plane (or any free one) in flight, as in stage D. Players who hold
  no slot stay in the lobby while it flies.
- **`start now`**: the mission flies from the start, and after each restart;
  players who join, or get ready, take their slot's plane in flight.
- **After a mission**: `after-end restart` keeps every player connected,
  back in the lobby with its slot and loadout and its ready mark cleared,
  and after the restart delay the fresh mission waits in the lobby (or flies,
  with `start now`). With rotation this loads the next entry; `after-end quit`
  disconnects everyone after the cycle. Without rotation it quits after one mission.
- **Nobody is King** by default: the King's requests (change the mission and
  the settings, start, end the mission, kick, pass the crown, lock a slot)
  are refused with "Only the King may do that."; the console still ends and
  restarts, kicks a seated player by seat, and kicks any player by lobby id
  (`kick-player`). With `king first-player` the server has a King (below).
- **Loadouts** are chosen in the lobby; one sent while the mission flies is
  refused. A player whose own copy of a loadout's other weapon differs from
  the server's is told at the flight's start and kept in the lobby for that
  flight, and may fly the next. A game with no lobby screen
  (`tore-app --connect`, `tore-bot`) takes its slot and marks ready by
  itself, so a server with `start first-player` starts as soon as the first
  such player joins, as before.

### Minimum players

*Opinionated, requested by John on 2026-10-16 and extended on 2026-10-22.*
`min-players N` keeps the mission in the lobby until N players hold slots,
are ready, can play the mission and are not leaving. AI on and off use the
same gate; unfilled slots with AI off stay empty and allow later joins when
`join-in-progress on`. The lobby and log say, for example:

```text
Waiting for 2 more ready players (minimum 4).
```

When unset, the initial minimum is 2 for AI-off PvP, 1 for AI-off co-op,
and 0 for AI-on. These defaults are agent decisions. An explicit 0 (`none`)
requires no extra minimum beyond one ready player, except AI-on `start now`
can still start empty. Lobby changes to AI or mode keep the displayed minimum.
A player-hosted lobby's King can edit **Minimum players** in Settings > Revival.
A dedicated server's King needs `king-mission open`; with `locked` the operator
retains control. The row applies once on Close/F10; Escape discards the draft.
See the [behaviour specification](spec/multiplayer-menus.md#minimum-players).

| `start` | `min-players` | The mission starts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `first-player` | 0 or 1 | When the first player holding a slot is ready (0 and 1 are the same) |
| `first-player` | N, 2 or more | When the Nth such player is ready |
| `now` | 0 | AI on: at once, with nobody in it. AI off: after one player is ready |
| `now` | N, 1 or more | Like `first-player` with that minimum: it waits in the lobby, and a restart or the next rotation entry waits again |
| `king first-player` | any | When the King presses Fly and the minimum is met; the King's Fly is refused with the wait line until then. Force Start (a 10 second countdown when someone holding a slot is not ready) is available to that King on the same terms as a player who hosts, and it does not start the mission while the minimum is unmet |

Rules and decisions (agent decisions unless noted):

- **Range.** 0 to `max-players`, checked when the file is read and refused with
  the line of the `min-players` setting, whichever of the two settings is written
  first ("line 2: `min-players` is 5, but `max-players` is 4: the minimum must be 0
  to 4"). It is also refused if the mission has fewer open slots than the
  minimum, counting `open-planes` and `mode` ("min-players is 3, but the mission
  in mission.txt has only 2 open slots for players (`min-players` is on line 4 of
  the configuration file)"), at start-up, in `--check`
  and at `reload`, for every rotation entry on its own ("Rotation entry 2 (line
  4): ..."). The check is against both `max-players` and the open slots, since
  either one makes the minimum impossible. The host also never waits for more
  players than it can seat (a closed slot or a lower player limit), so a
  minimum cannot hold a lobby for ever.
- **Rotation.** `min-players` is mission-scoped: an entry's own value applies
  to that round only, and the next entry inherits `server.conf` again. A round
  that starts again, by restart, the end of a mission or the next entry, applies
  its minimum again; players come back to the lobby with their ready marks
  cleared.
- **Only the start.** The minimum gates the start and nothing else. Once the
  mission flies, players who leave do not stop or pause it, and players who
  join later take a free plane in flight as before.
- **King permission.** The player-hosted King can change the minimum. A
  dedicated server permits it with `king-mission open`; `locked` preserves
  the operator's value and greys the row. A mode change keeps the minimum,
  capped at the new human capacity.
- **Log lines.** The wait is a plain log line, never a `fault:` line. The
  server logs it once each time the reason changes (a fresh lobby that waits
  for two or more players, then after each ready player's attempt), and again
  when the console's `start now` is refused.

### The King's settings and a King

*Built (F2-1).* The file's King's settings (`mode`, `kill-limit` and the
rest) apply from the start, whether or not the server has a King, and every
player sees them in the lobby. With `king first-player` (John, 2026-10-05):

- **The crown** goes to the first player to join; when the King leaves, to the
  player connected longest. The log says "Viper wears the crown", and "Viper
  passed the crown to Hawk" when the King gives it away.
- **The King** changes the mission and the settings, locks slots (closed, or
  kept for a callsign), starts the mission, ends it, kicks and passes the
  crown, with the same rules as in a game a player hosts
  ([architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-kings-lobby-as-built-f2-1)). The log
  names every change: "Viper changed the settings: mode pvp, kill-limit 3".
- **The start** is the King's while a King is connected: `start first-player`
  and `start now` wait for the King's Fly, and come back once nobody wears the
  crown.
- **`king-mission locked`** keeps the file's mission and settings: the King's
  changes are refused "This server's mission and settings are its
  operator's."; start, kick, slot locks and the crown still work. The lobby
  tells every player (protocol 20, slice K1), so the King's Mission... opens
  the read-only page, "This server's mission is fixed.", instead of an editor
  whose Accept would be refused.
- **Empty again.** Once the last player has been gone for the `empty-timeout`
  and the server is in its lobby, it goes back to its file's mission and
  settings and opens every slot, so a public server does not keep a
  stranger's choices: "The server has been empty for its empty timeout: back to
  its file's mission and settings".

## Joining from the game

*Since EF7* the game joins a server from its menus too: Choose Activity, Multi,
**Direct Connection**. The screen lists the games and servers found on the
local network (a server answers the search on its game port), and **Join**
joins the selected one; a server elsewhere is joined by typing its address or
name in *Connect to* (and its port after a colon, when it is not the Options
port). Callsign and password are the screen's too (the password is in
Options). A refusal (full, wrong password, another version, a content check)
is a line in the screen's Messages and the screen stays. While the screen is
open it holds the game port for its search: a server started on this machine
meanwhile cannot bind the port, and says so ("is a game's Direct Connection
screen open on this machine?"); close the screen first, or give the server
another `port`. When the server's port is already taken the other way round,
the screen's search listens on another port, says so in Messages, and still
finds the server on this machine;
[how the screen works](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-direct-connection-screen-as-built-ef7).

*Since EF8* a successful join opens the **lobby screen**, the same screen a
hosting player sees without the King's buttons
([how it works](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-lobby-screen-as-built-ef8)). A server has
no King, so the lobby shows the server's start rule in plain words: with
`start first-player` "This server starts the mission as soon as the first
player holding a slot is ready", with `start now` "This server's mission is
always flying: take a slot and press Ready to join it". The player clicks a
free slot to take it, may press **Loadout** to arm that aircraft (the server
checks it with the Load Ordnance page's rules and refuses Cheat loading),
and presses **Ready** (it reads **Join** while the mission flies). End Mission in
flight returns that player to the server's lobby with its debrief, while the
server's mission goes on; **Leave** returns to Direct Connection, and a server
that stops or kicks the player puts its reason in Direct Connection's
Messages ("The server ended the connection: the server is stopping."; a
player the console removes with `kick-player` reads "The server removed you
from the game: REASON", since a server has no King).
A game with no lobby screen (`tore-app --connect`, `tore-bot`) still takes a
slot and marks ready by itself.

The game also joins a server from the command line:

```sh
tore-app --connect 192.168.1.20 --callsign Viper
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--connect HOST[:PORT]` | The server's address or name; the port defaults to 26900 |
| `--callsign NAME` | 1 to 15 printable ASCII characters, none given means `Pilot`; a callsign already in use gets a suffix (`Viper_2`), shortened first to stay within 15 |
| `--slot N` | The plane to take; without it, the first free friendly plane, friendly wing 1's lead first |
| `--password TEXT` | The server's password, if it has one |

`HOST` is a name or an address; an IPv6 address needs brackets to carry a
port (`[fe80::1]:26900`). *Since EF5,* a name that gives several addresses
(for example an IPv4 and an IPv6 one) is tried address by address, IPv4 first,
three seconds each, and the first that answers the handshake is joined (one
address is joined as it is); `tore-bot --connect` does the same. The game
remembers the address, the callsign (when `--callsign` gave one), the port and
the game name in `network-v1.conf` in its data folder, beside the other
preference files; the password is never kept. The options are checked at start, before anything is
sent, and a game started with `--retail-stall-speeds` refuses to join (every
machine in a session flies the same aircraft model). `--callsign`, `--slot`
and `--password` go with `--connect` and nothing else. While it flies, the game
keeps a [diagnostics log and a capture](ARCHITECTURE.md#recordings-and-diagnostics)
and records no replay.

Once the options pass, the game opens its window as usual and joins in the
background: the main menu shows "Joining ..." while it connects, loads the
mission and is seated, and then the flight screen takes over. In the flight
there is no pause and no time compression, the Restart key and the Cheat
rows that change the mission are refused or hidden (the server sets the
cheats), and the Esc menu draws over the running flight: while it is up, or the
window has lost focus, the aircraft flies on with the stick centred, the
throttle held and the trigger released. A plane that is refused (taken,
destroyed, not open) is asked for again as any free plane. End Mission leaves
the game: the host sends the debrief, which the game shows before the main
menu. *Since EF4* the game joins the [lobby](#the-lobby): it takes `--slot`'s
slot (or the first free one) with the standard loadout and marks ready by
itself; when a mission ends it shows the debrief, stays connected, readies
again and flies the next mission when it starts; the lobby's changes go to
the game's log. A drop,
a refusal, a data mismatch or a server stopping is a plain message on the
main menu. A client draws gun rounds: its own at once from its trigger, and
other aircraft's from the host's burst events. They are for the eye only; the
host decides every hit.

The game loads the mission from its own import and compares its content
manifest with the server's: the names and hashes of every resource the
simulation reads for that mission (aircraft, weapons, theater, radio phrases).
A 1.0 disc import and a 1.02F import play together, since they differ only in
menu and HUD resources. A difference is refused with the names of the files
that differ. The protocol and [compatibility code](ARCHITECTURE.md#compatibility-code)
must match as well. Different commits, release tags and version strings can
join with the same code. `tore-server --data-dir /path/to/profile --version`
prints the code of that import; without an import it labels an empty-content
code explicitly. The code covers the whole playable import, so a change to
an unused item also prevents joining.

## Hosting from the game

*Since EF7* a player hosts from the menus too: Choose Activity, Multi,
**Direct Connection**, **New**. It hosts the Quick Mission creator's current
mission (build it first on the creator's page) under the game name, port and
password of Options, and the game's own player is the house, which wears
the crown; unlike `--host`
it opens the lobby, where the King builds the mission with **Mission...**
(the Quick Mission creator, its OK reading Accept), takes a slot, arms the
aircraft with **Loadout**, readies, and presses **Fly** when everyone holding a
slot is ready; after the mission the debrief returns everyone to the lobby.
**Leave** closes the game for everyone (the King is asked first). A port in use
is a line in the screen's Messages. [How the screens
work](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-lobby-screen-as-built-ef8).

A player can also host a game from the command line, and the others join it
with `--connect` (or from their menus):

```sh
tore-app --host duel.txt --callsign Viper
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--host MISSION_FILE` | Host this [mission file](#the-mission-file), the dedicated server's format |
| `--port N` | The UDP port to listen on, on every IPv4 and IPv6 address; default 26900 |
| `--name TEXT` | The game's name, shown to joining players; 1 to 60 printable characters, default `CALLSIGN's game` |
| `--open-planes friendly\|all\|N,N` | Which planes players may take, as the `open-planes` setting; default `friendly` |
| `--password TEXT` | The password joining players must give; the hosting player's own game gives it too |
| `--callsign NAME`, `--slot N` | The hosting player's own, as for `--connect` |
| `--list` | Also list the game on the Internet Lobby (I3), as a server with `broadcast on` lists itself |
| `--master HOST[:PORT]` | The master `--list` lists on; default the public one, port 26901 when none is given |

The game runs the same host session as `tore-server`, on a thread of its own
with its own 120 ticks a second, and joins it as an ordinary client over an
in-process link: the hosting player flies through exactly the screens a
joining player sees, with no delay, and a stalled or minimized window stalls
nobody else ([design](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-host-inside-the-game-stage-e)). The
others join with `tore-app --connect` to the hosting machine's address, through
the same port and firewall as a server ([ports and
firewalls](#ports-and-firewalls)).

*Built (EF3, EF4). Agent decisions:* the server's defaults (`max-players
30`, `snapshot-rate 60`, no time limit), except that the hosting player is the
King of the [lobby](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-lobby): the game takes its slot
(`--slot`, or the first free one) and readies by itself, and starts each
mission as soon as every player holding a slot is ready and the hosting player
is not reading a debrief (a game hosted from the menus never starts by itself: its King presses Fly). End
Mission ends the mission for everyone: each player gets "Mission ended" and
their debrief and is back in the lobby, still connected, and the next mission
starts as before. A mission nobody flies any more ends at once (no empty
timeout). The hosting player's own connection is never dropped for silence, so
dragging or resizing the window, or a long load, stalls only that game while
the others fly on. When the hosting player leaves the game (the window closes, Exit),
the game ends for everyone: each remote player gets "Mission ended" (the host
left the game) and their debrief if they were flying, and "The host left the
game", and the port is free again at once. A mission file that cannot be read, a line it does not take or an option
out of range refuses the start with the file and line, as the server refuses
them; a mission the import cannot build, an `--open-planes` plane the mission
lacks or a port in use is a plain message on the main menu. If the host fails
while flying, the hosting player is told "The game you were hosting stopped:
..." and the remote players "the server is stopping", or, if even that cannot
be sent, the usual "no packets for 5 seconds". The host's log lines go to the
game's log with `Host:` in front, and the hosted session keeps the same
diagnostics log and capture as a joined one, the capture named `hosted`.

*Built (I3).* With `--list` the host thread talks to the master from the
game port, as a [broadcasting server](#broadcasting-on-the-internet-lobby)
does, and the game's log says where the listing stands ("Listed on the
Internet Lobby, seen at ADDRESS." or "The Internet Lobby does not answer, so
the game is not listed. Players can still join by address."); leaving the
game takes it off the list at once. A game hosted without `--list`, and
every game hosted from Direct Connection, never talks to the master. *Built
(I4, 2026-10-05):* `--list` follows the Internet Lobby's statistics switch
(on by default, in `network-v1.conf`): it sends the install id and the
hosting game's Report at the end of the session, and the first time it says the
one-time notice on the console and in the log (*agent decision*, a command line
has no screen). Turn them off in the Internet Lobby's Options.

*Since F2-1* the King's Visibility setting lists a hosted game as well:
`public` lists it on the Internet Lobby (a game hosted without `--list` then
lists itself on the public master, with no statistics), `local` or `hidden`
takes it off, and `hidden` also stops answering the local network's search. A
game hosted with `--list` starts public. The King can pass the crown to another
player; the hosting player stays the house, whose leaving still ends the game.

## Finding games from the command line

*Built (EF5).* To check what a network shows without opening the game:

```sh
tore-app --find-games 8 [--port 26900]
```

It looks for games on the local network for that many seconds (0.1 to 3600)
and prints each game when it first answers, one line each on stdout, fields
separated by tabs: address, whether the code matches (`matching code`, `other code` or `other protocol`, with the host's code, version and commit), name, mission
summary, players and capacity, phase (`lobby`, `flying`, `closed`), the King
(`-` for a dedicated server), `password` or `open`, `full` or `not full`.
When nothing answers it prints `No games found.` and exits 0 all the same;
what it is doing (and the version line) goes to stderr, so the output can be
read by a script. It takes no window and no import. Run it on a second
machine with a host or a server up on the first: it is the way to check
[discovery](#discovery-and-the-firewall) between machines. `--port` is the
game port the hosts use. Any other session option (`--connect`, `--host`, ...)
is refused with it.

*Built (I4).* `tore-app --browse SECONDS [--master HOST[:PORT]]` does the same for
the Internet Lobby: it asks the master (the one in the Internet Lobby's Options,
else `master.jroverton.com:26901`) for that many seconds and prints one line per
listed game on stdout (name, players, phase, password, full, build, whether it
is a dedicated server, the relay mark, then its mission, King and players),
`N games listed.` or `No games listed.`. A master that cannot be found or does
not answer exits 1 with the reason on stderr. Only `--master` goes with it.

## Broadcasting on the Internet Lobby

*Built (I3, 2026-10-05).* A server is private unless its operator turns
broadcasting on (John, 2026-10-05, as OpenRA's servers do): with `broadcast
on` in the configuration, or `broadcast on` typed at the console, it lists
itself on the master server, and the game's Internet Lobby shows it. Players
then join it as they join any listed game; joining by address works either
way. How listing works on the wire is the master protocol's
[listing a game](formats/master-protocol.md#listing-a-game); the design is
the architecture guide's [master server and
connectivity](ARCHITECTURE.md#master-server-and-connectivity).

- The server talks to the master **from its game port**, so the master sees
  the outside address players reach, and nothing else needs forwarding: the
  same UDP port rule covers both. The master's datagrams never reach the
  host session.
- It registers at once (the master first checks that the address is really
  the server's), sends the lobby's summary (name, mission, players, whether
  it has a password, lobby or flying, build) every 30 seconds and within 5
  seconds of a change, and a small keep-alive every 15 seconds so the
  router keeps the port open. `quit` and `broadcast off` take it off the
  list at once; a server that dies drops off within 90 seconds.
- The log says what happens: `Broadcasting: listed on the Internet Lobby
  (HOST:PORT), seen at ADDRESS` (the address the master saw, which is the
  one players outside reach), a new address when the router changes it, the
  router test's result, and `Broadcasting: the Internet Lobby at ... does
  not answer, so the server is not listed. Players can still join by
  address.` when the master is silent for 10 seconds. It then asks again
  after 2, 4, 8 and up to 15 seconds, at the master's next address each
  time (round and back to the first), and looks the master's name up again
  at once and every minute while the master stays silent. Each change of
  address is one line, `Broadcasting: the Internet Lobby at HOST:PORT: now
  trying ADDRESS instead of ADDRESS (no answer)` (or `(cannot send there:
  ...)` for a failed send, which moves on at once, `(the master answered
  from it)`, `(a new lookup of the master's name)`), and a send that fails
  with nowhere else to go is `Broadcasting: cannot send to the Internet
  Lobby at ADDRESS: ...`, once per address until the next lookup. An
  address the server's socket or the machine has no route to (an IPv6 one
  on a machine or container without IPv6) is tried only when nothing else
  is left, so a server lists itself again within 15 seconds of the master
  answering, with no restart
  ([finding the master again](formats/master-protocol.md#finding-the-master-again)).
- **Anonymous statistics.** While broadcasting with `telemetry on` (the
  default), the server sends the master one report at the end of each
  mission: its version and system, the mission's minutes, the most players
  at once, its players counted by how they connected (in stage I: the local
  network or by address), and how its router maps the port. The registration
  carries the same anonymous install id. *Agent decisions:* the id is kept in
  `server-install-id` in the data folder, drawn at start while telemetry is
  on; `telemetry off` deletes it, so a later id cannot be linked to the old.
  A server that does not broadcast sends nothing.
- *Agent decisions:* the master's second port, for the router test, is its
  main port plus one (26902 for 26901); the master's name is looked up on a
  thread at start and every 10 minutes, and every minute while the master is
  silent.

To try it on one machine, run a master on loopback ([testing on one
machine](MASTER-SERVER.md#testing-on-one-machine)) and set `broadcast on`
and `master 127.0.0.1:26911` in `server.conf`.

### Running your own master

Private environments and forks can run `tore-master` and have both servers and
players use it. Releases ship a separate Linux
`tore-master-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` archive, with a checksum, on the
[releases page](https://github.com/john-overton/T.O.R.E-Fighters/releases).
See [download instructions](MASTER-SERVER.md#downloading-a-release) or
[build it from source](MASTER-SERVER.md#building-it).

On the machine running the master, create `master.conf`:

```text
listen 0.0.0.0
port 26901
probe-port 26902
state-dir state
```

Run `tore-master --config master.conf --check-config`, then
`tore-master --config master.conf`. Allow incoming UDP 26901 and 26902 through
the firewall and point your DNS name at that machine. The second port tests
routers; relay traffic uses the main port. For a custom main port, use its
port plus one for `probe-port`. The [master guide](MASTER-SERVER.md) covers
IPv6 listeners, service installation, relay limits and logs.

On each dedicated server, set these entries in `server.conf`:

```text
broadcast on
master master.example.org:26901
```

Players open **Multi > Internet... > Options**, enter the same address in
**Master server**, and press **OK**. Browsing, hosting with New, introductions,
NAT traversal, relay and enabled anonymous statistics then use that master.
**Default**, followed by **OK**, returns to `master.jroverton.com:26901`.
Command-line players can use `tore-app --browse 5 --master master.example.org`
or `tore-app --host mission.txt --list --master master.example.org` for a
temporary override; it does not rewrite their preferences. For loopback tests,
use a free pair such as 26911 and 26912 and enter `127.0.0.1:26911` on both
server and player. Forks still need mutually compatible clients and servers;
choosing a different master does not bypass the game's compatibility checks.

### Running a master for old and new games

The updated `tore-master` serves released 0.2.0 hosts and clients (master
protocol 1, game protocol 67) alongside code-based hosts and clients (master
protocol 2, game protocol 71 and later). Upgrade the master first. Existing
0.2.0 servers can keep running and broadcasting without a game/server update.
Old requests receive the old layout and only old-generation listings; new
requests receive codes and only new-generation listings. Show other versions
does not cross that boundary. Direct introductions and relay setup also stay
within the generation. No new port or configuration setting is needed.

See [running and updating the master](MASTER-SERVER.md#updating) and the
[wire rules](formats/master-protocol.md#compatibility-codes-master-protocol-2).
This supports a gradual rollout; it does not make game protocols 67 and 71
play together.

## Console, status and logs

The server reads commands from its standard input:

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | One status line now |
| `players` | Every connected player: lobby id, seat, callsign, plane, round trip, loss, input margin, inputs repeated |
| `kick SEAT` | Gives the plane back to the AI and disconnects the player (a seated player; one in the lobby has no seat) |
| `kick-player ID [REASON]` | Removes the player with that lobby id (the `players` table's first column), in the lobby or flying, telling it the reason; its plane, if it flies one, goes back to the AI with no debrief (EF4) |
| `end` | Ends the mission now, with debriefs |
| `restart` | Ends the mission and starts it again at once (the current entry with rotation) |
| `rotation` | Lists rotation entries, marking the current entry with `*` |
| `next` | Ends with debriefs and advances after `restart-delay` |
| `goto N` | Ends with debriefs and selects rotation entry N after the delay |
| `reload` | Validates the rotation again; applies a valid replacement at the next mission boundary |
| `broadcast on`, `broadcast off` | Lists the server on the Internet Lobby, or takes it off at once, whatever the configuration said (I3) |
| `quit` | Tells every player the server is stopping, then exits |

Ctrl+C stops the process at once instead; the players' games report the lost
connection after 5 seconds. *Built (D7b), agent decisions:* `help` lists the
commands; a console whose input ends (a service with no terminal) is left
alone, so only `quit` or a signal stops the server; `kick` names a seat as
`players` shows it, and a seat with no player is answered, not an error; the
console thread only reads lines, and the run loop acts on them within 4 ms.

A status line every `status-interval` seconds:

```text
00:12:30 tick 90000 players 2/15 aircraft 30 load 11% (1.1 ms a tick) up 64 KB/s down 7 KB/s, worst 52.3 ms
```

While the server broadcasts, the line includes where its listing stands,
for example `, broadcast: listed, seen at 203.0.113.5:26900` (I3), before
`worst`. Both periodic lines and console `status` append the slowest tick
since the previous status call, in milliseconds. With no ticks it is zero.
The mean tick cost and load still cover the same interval; a low mean can
hide a large pause, so use `worst` to see individual spikes.

The log (`logs/server-<date>.log` in the data folder) records the start,
every connection, refusal, seat change and departure with its reason, the
mission's end, every chat line a player sends (*built, EF6*: `chat: Viper to
friendlies (2 heard): Form up`, with the sender, the receiver and how many
others heard it; a line the host refuses is a refusal line), what each
player's import holds and what not everyone can use (*built, L3*: below),
the lobby pass's lines about the AI and the lead (*built, R1 and R2*: "Red
2-3 lost plane 7: the AI respawns it in 0:30", "Red 2-5 respawned in plane 14
at its original spawn, x 81.2 nm, z 40.0 nm", "waits for room to respawn", "no
lives left"; "Blue 1 lead belongs to Viper", "passes to plane 1 (AI), standing
in for Viper", "goes back to Viper in plane 12", "has no owner now"; and
Autobalance's seating, "Alpha took the slot of plane 6"), the wait to start ("Waiting for 2 more ready players (minimum 4).", with AI on or off), the removal of a departed player's plane when AI is off, and once a minute
each player's figures: the same round trip,
loss, snapshot arrival spread, input margin, inputs repeated and bytes each
way that a player's game writes to its own
[diagnostics log](ARCHITECTURE.md#recordings-and-diagnostics).

**Content and gaps** (*built, L3, 2026-10-05*;
[compatibility](ARCHITECTURE.md#compatibility)). After the start lines the
server says what its own import is (`Content: Fighters Anthology 1.02F,
imported by T.O.R.E 0.1.4 (48d62dac), 162 items`). A `content` line follows
each player's join: its Fighters Anthology build, the T.O.R.E that made its
import, and the items it lacks, has differently or has that the server lacks
(up to twelve named, then "and N more"):

```text
content Hawk: Fighters Anthology 1.0, imported by T.O.R.E 0.1.4 (48d62dac); the same items as the host
content Ace: Fighters Anthology 1.02F, imported by T.O.R.E 0.2.0 (9a1b2c3d); lacks aircraft SU27.PT, aircraft MIG29.PT
```

A `gaps` line says what not every player can use whenever that changes: a
join, a leave, or `gaps: none` once the last such player has gone.

```text
gaps: aircraft SU27.PT (Ace lacks it); weapon AIM9X.JT (Hawk differs)
```

The server's own mission is never refused for a gap: a player who cannot fly
it stays in the lobby, unable, with the reason in the log as before, now
about the item ("Ace's game has no Su-27, which this mission flies."). A King
on the server cannot choose a mission or a loadout that uses an item in a
gap. These lines go to the console and the log alike.

*Built (D7b).* Every log line starts with a UTC date and time, and a new file
starts at UTC midnight (the standard library has no time zones; agent
decision). The start lines, joins, refusals, seat changes, departures, the
mission's end and console actions also appear on the console. Status lines go
to the console only, and each player's once-a-minute figures line to the log
file only. The figures line also carries the bytes
sent to and received from that player since it joined. A log file that cannot
be written is reported once on the console and the server carries on without
it. The clock the run loop waits on sleeps until 0.4 ms (0.75 ms on Windows, whose
short sleeps overshoot by about half a millisecond; 2 ms before 0.2.2, which
kept a Windows server spinning about a fifth of a core) before each deadline and then spins; the host catches up
any tick a late wake-up missed (agent decision).

**How late the loop wakes (measured on the CI runners, EF-X, 2026-10-01).**
On Linux and Windows a sleep lasts what it asks: a 16 ms sleep took 16.1 to
16.4 ms on average and at most 16.9, a 1 ms one 1.06 to 1.08 ms, and the loop
woke for a 120 Hz tick under 4 microseconds late on average, at most 1.2 ms
on Windows. **On macOS it can be far worse:** on both macOS runners a 16 ms
sleep took 27 to 90 ms on average and up to 154 ms, a 1 ms one 2 to 8 ms, and
the loop woke 1.2 to 7.5 ms late on average and up to 36 ms. The cause is
macOS's timer coalescing for a process it does not treat as in the
foreground: the runners' processes run at utility QoS, and the kernel then
lets a timer slip by up to 75 ms (`kern.timer_coalesce_tier3_ns_max`). Raising
the thread's QoS did not change it; a real-time (time-constraint) thread did
(16.04 ms).

**On a Mac the loop now wakes on time (EF-M, 2026-10-01).** On macOS the
server runs its loop as a real-time thread (a Mach time-constraint policy:
one 120 Hz tick of period, half a tick of computation; agent decision) and
holds an App Nap exemption, latency-critical and user-initiated, for its
whole life, which also keeps the Mac from idle sleep while it runs. After
the start lines the log says what took: "macOS real-time scheduling on", or
what was refused and why. On the macOS runners this
brought a 120 Hz tick to under 0.3 ms late on average and at most 1.4 ms,
and a 16 ms sleep to 16.0 to 16.6 ms on average
([every figure](ARCHITECTURE.md#sleep-and-wait-accuracy-on-each-system-ef-x)).
A game that hosts does the same on its host thread. Linux and Windows are
unchanged. Started from Terminal, by launchd or in a hidden window, a Mac
host is expected to keep its tick, but this is measured on the CI runners
only, not on a real Mac. One known gap: just after the loop's thread has
worked for a long time without a break (a mission rebuilt, between missions)
macOS may briefly let it wake late again; the Intel runner showed late
stretches of up to 0.1 s after half a second of such work.

## Ports and firewalls

The server uses one UDP port, 26900 unless set. On a LAN nothing else is
needed. For players on the internet, forward that UDP port on the router to the
server by hand, or let the server ask the router with `port-mapping on`. *Built (J4b).*
The server asks by UPnP, NAT-PMP and PCP at once when it starts, logs what the router did
(`Port mapping: Your router forwards UDP port 26900 (UPnP). Friends can join at
203.0.113.5:26900.`, or why not), tells the master the outside address
when it broadcasts, asks again after 10 minutes if the router did not answer, and removes the
mapping when it stops. A router behind another router cannot be mapped; the log says so.
NAT traversal and the relay are the rest of stage J. A
server that [broadcasts](#broadcasting-on-the-internet-lobby) talks to the
master from the same port, so it needs no other rule.
Windows and macOS ask once whether the unsigned program may accept connections.

The start line `Listening on UDP` shows the sockets. Listening on every
address (the default), Linux and macOS listen with one IPv6 socket that takes
IPv4 as well, `[::]:26900`; Windows, whose IPv6 sockets take IPv6 only,
listens with two, `[::]:26900 and 0.0.0.0:26900`. Either way one firewall
rule for the UDP port covers both. When another program holds the port for
IPv4 (another server, or a game's Direct Connection screen on this machine),
the server refuses to start on every system rather than listen on IPv6 alone
([the game port on each system](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-game-port-on-each-system-ef-x)).

## Discovery and the firewall

*Built (EF5).* The server, and a game that hosts, answer a discovery query on
the game port ([wire protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#discovery)): a game on
the local network lists them without being told an address. Nothing needs to
be set up. The answer carries the game's name, mission, players, King, whether
it has a password or is full, and whether it is in the lobby or flying, in a
packet never longer than the question.

The question is a broadcast to 255.255.255.255 on the game port, so it reaches
a host only where the network passes broadcast and the host's firewall lets
UDP on the game port in. On the host's machine:

- **Linux.** A firewall that denies incoming traffic by default drops the
  broadcast and the joins alike: allow the game port, for example `sudo ufw
  allow 26900/udp`. On the development machine (ufw active)
  a broadcast to its own network interface never reached its own sockets, while
  one to the loopback network did; ufw's default deny is the likely cause (not
  confirmed: checking needs root). The server's one IPv6 socket takes IPv4
  and IPv4 broadcast (checked on Linux and on a macOS CI runner).
- **Windows.** The first run asks whether the program may accept connections;
  allow it on the private network. The public-network profile blocks incoming
  broadcast. The server binds a separate IPv4 socket there, as it does for
  joins, which is what receives the broadcast (checked on a Windows CI
  runner, EF-X).
- **macOS.** The same first-run question; allow incoming connections. One
  IPv6 socket takes IPv4 and the broadcast, as on Linux.

The searching machine matters too. The search socket is bound to the game
port itself when that port is free, so the same firewall rule that lets joins
in (`sudo ufw allow 26900/udp`) also lets the answers to a broadcast in: a
stateful firewall such as ufw cannot match a reply to a 255.255.255.255 query
and drops it on any other port, which is why a search from an ephemeral port
found only the unicast targets (this machine's own addresses) on the
development machine. When the game port is taken (this game is hosting, or a
server runs on it) the search uses another port, the log says so, and answers
to a broadcast may be dropped by such a firewall. The search holds the game
port while it runs, so a server started on this machine meanwhile cannot bind
it (on every system since EF-X: before it, macOS and Windows started the
server on IPv6 alone, where no IPv4 player reached it); the game's Direct Connection screen stops its search before it hosts.

A machine on several networks (a laptop with Wi-Fi and a VPN) sends its
question out of the default interface only; a host on another network is
joined by its address. Wi-Fi networks that isolate clients, and guest networks,
pass neither broadcast nor joins. Discovery is best effort: joining by address
always works.

## Running it as a service

On Linux, a systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=T.O.R.E-Fighters dedicated server

## Running it in Docker

The repository's multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds `tore-server` with the pinned
Rust toolchain, `--locked` and the release profile. Its Debian 12 runtime has
glibc 2.36. The image contains no game data. The build context allows source
inputs only, excluding retail media, imports, `.local/`, `target/` and `dist/`.

On Linux with Docker Compose, copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to
`compose.yml`. Create `server-config/` with `server.conf`, its mission files
and any rotation file, and create `server-data/` for the import. The mounted
data folder must be writable by the configured user (1000:1000 by default;
set `TORE_UID` and `TORE_GID` for another account).

```sh
export TORE_BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
docker compose build
# Mount your installed game or disc folder for this one import only.
docker compose run --rm -v /path/to/FIGHTERS:/media:ro server \
  --data-dir /data --import /media
docker compose run --rm server --config /config/server.conf --check
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f server
```

The example uses host networking, one container per server and
`restart: unless-stopped`. For several servers, duplicate the service with
distinct config/data mounts and a distinct UDP port in each `server.conf`.
Use separate writable data copies: loading prunes import generations, city
cache temporary names include process IDs that can repeat across containers,
and logs and installation identities belong to each server. Do not import or
update a running server's data. Host networking has no Compose `ports` block;
allow and forward each server's UDP port on the host firewall and router.

The console stays open through `stdin_open` and `tty`. Attach with
`docker attach --sig-proxy=false "$(docker compose ps -q server)"`, then type
`status`, `rotation` or another [console command](#console-status-and-logs).
Detach with Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q. `docker exec` opens a separate process and does
not connect to the server's console.

Stop with `docker compose stop` or `docker compose down`. The entrypoint
turns SIGTERM into the server's `quit` command and waits for it, allowing
player disconnects, Internet Lobby withdrawal and port-mapping removal.
The example gives it 120 seconds, including a mission build in progress.
Avoid `docker kill` or a zero-second stop, which skips that cleanup.
The container preserves the server's exit status. Docker logs are bounded;
the server also writes dated logs in the mounted data folder.

After updating the source, rebuild with its new `TORE_BUILD_COMMIT`, then
run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`. Development clients must match
the build commit and protocol; this image does not label an untagged build
as an official release. Check each rotation after an update before making
the servers public. Set `broadcast on` and `port-mapping on` only when ready
to list the server and ask the router to forward its port.

## Performance

Measured on the development machine (Ryzen 9 7900X, release build) with real
data and the headless bot, on a 15 against 15 Quick Mission, at the default
60 snapshots a second (slice D12, 2026-10-06; [the baseline](baselines/net-rates-2026-10-06.md)
has the method, every figure and the same runs at 30 a second):

| Humans | Host cost a tick, whole run (busiest minute) | Share of one core | Upload to each player, mean (busiest second) | Upload in total, mean (busiest second) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 0.8 ms (1.7) | 10% | 19.8 KB/s (66) | 40 KB/s, 0.32 Mbit/s (131 KB/s) |
| 8 | 1.3 ms (2.7) | 15% | 23.5 KB/s (74) | 188 KB/s, 1.50 Mbit/s (520 KB/s) |
| 15 | 2.1 ms (3.6) | 25% | 21.9 KB/s (74) | 329 KB/s, 2.63 Mbit/s (1,020 KB/s) |
| 30 | 3.4 ms (4.6) | 41% | 26.3 KB/s (63) | 788 KB/s, 6.31 Mbit/s (1,777 KB/s) |

About 2.7 KB/s comes back from each player. A tick is 8.3 ms, so one core
carries 30 humans at about two fifths of it. Each player's snapshots are
built on their own tick of each interval (seat number modulo the ticks per
snapshot, two at 60 a second), so with 30 players a tick builds at most 15
snapshots instead of 30; the 99th percentile tick with 30 is 7 ms and the
longest 10 to 11 ms. The few ticks over 8.3 ms are run late and caught up,
never skipping time. A server on a machine that is also busy with other work
reports "overloaded" while it catches up; give a 30-player server a core of
its own. The bytes are the transport's payload, without the 28 bytes of IP
and UDP headers on each packet.

**Threads and `TORE_WORKERS`.** The simulation runs on the server's loop
thread. Since optimization slice S9 the server starts no worker threads at
the default: a pool of at most four is built the first time the loop is slow
or late (a tick over its 8.3 ms budget, or more than one tick owed), and the
work returns to the loop thread after a second of keeping up. A flying
server with a dozen AI used about 12% of a core with 174 wake-ups a second
this way, against 14% and 1,254 with the eight workers it used to start.
`TORE_WORKERS=N` in the server's environment forces a fixed count instead:
`0` never uses workers, `2` to `8` always do (capped at eight), and an
unset variable is the load-aware default. Results are identical whatever
the setting; it changes only which threads do the work.

**Upload.** At 60 snapshots a second the server sends about twice what it
did at 30 (1.50 Mbit/s with 15 players and 3.58 with 30 at 30 a second, the
same day). On a weaker uplink, lower `snapshot-rate`: 30, the
rate until 2026-10-06, halves the snapshots' share.
The plan's [bandwidth budget](multiplayer-plan.md#bandwidth-budget) compares
the figures with its estimates.

## Security

Traffic is not encrypted in v1: the password keeps strangers out, but anyone
who can watch the network can read it. The server trusts no packet it cannot
decode and limits connection attempts
([wire protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#security)). Run it under its own user.
It reads its configuration, its mission file and its data folder, and writes
only its logs.

## Not in stage D

One mission at a time, Quick Missions only. The lobby, slots and loadout
choice before flight are built (EF4); the King's settings, chat, respawns,
PvP scoring, observers, the server browser and NAT traversal are stages F, I
and J; holding a dropped player's plane for a rejoin is stage K.

## AI-off and Player Choice status

Opinionated, requested by John on 2026-10-16. `ai off` applies only to
multiplayer aircraft. Idle players retain neutral-control keepalive; their
planes are not handed to AI. A live departure removes the aircraft without a
kill or loss and opens its slot. A new player enters at revive placement without
spending a revival. Agent decisions: co-op is allowed without enemy aircraft;
AI defaults remain mandatory so enabling AI never invalidates the mission;
neither King nor console bypasses the ready-player minimum. `start now` with
AI off waits like `first-player`. Empty slots do not block Fly or Force Start.
The wait is a plain log line, such as `Waiting for 1 more ready player (minimum 2).`
When AI is off and a player leaves a flying
mission, the log says `Bravo left: plane 1 removed (AI is off)`. See
[minimum players](#minimum-players) for `min-players`, which uses the same
ready count and wait text.

Player Choice mission text, lobby selections and flight-start distribution are
implemented in this slice. Changing aircraft on a late join or revival and the
in-flight Load Ordnance overlay are still unfinished. Do not treat this as the
complete Player Choice feature. The requested behavior is specified in the
[creator specification](spec/quick-mission-menu.md#multiplayer-player-choice).

## Recording and feedback

These settings apply to the whole server, including every rotation entry:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `record-replays off|on` | `off` | Record each authoritative mission as an ordinary replay |
| `feedback off|on` | `off` | Offer Feedback... to flying players |
| `replays-kept N` | `10` | Keep this many complete unflagged server recordings, from 0 to 100,000 |
| `replays-folder PATH` | data folder's `replays/` | Destination; explicit relative paths start at the configuration file's folder |

`feedback on` requires `record-replays on`. Startup refuses that combination
when recording is off. Players see the button only on enabled dedicated
servers, never in single player or player-hosted games. The host logs each
accepted submission as `Feedback from Viper at 12:34: ...`, with the flag's
mission minute and second. The player's local recording also keeps it.

Files are named `server-<UTC seconds>-<nanoseconds>.tore-replay`; a `.log` with
the same stem holds mission combat and server events. Normal mission end,
rotation and console `quit` finish the recording. An interrupted process can
leave a recoverable `.partial` recording.

Replay encoding, writes, syncs and companion-log writes run on a dedicated
writer thread. Flight hands off frames without waiting for the disk. Chunk
size and sync cadence are unchanged: 120-frame chunks, a sync every 3,600
written frames, and a final sync on finish. The queue and writer chunk share
a 7,200-frame unwritten budget, about 60 seconds at 120 Hz. Multi-second disk
stalls can therefore clear without ending the recording or disabling feedback.
A process crash can lose these unwritten frames. A machine or power failure
can also lose written frames from the current unsynced interval. The sync
cadence counts written frames, not wall-clock time while disk work is stalled.
This added crash exposure is accepted to preserve recording through realistic
I/O delays. See [measured memory use](baselines/recorder-io.md) for sizing.
When the full minute's budget is exhausted, the server logs
`Recording failed: replay writer queue full`, stops recording and disables
feedback for the rest of this mission. Flight continues. Accepted frames drain to a recoverable `.partial`
file with its companion log; the file is never labeled complete.
The next mission starts a fresh recording. Mission end, rotation, host
handover, Stop and graceful shutdown wait for the writer to flush and join.
See the [recording policy](spec/replay-feedback.md) for the precise bounds.

After a mission finishes, rotation deletes the oldest complete, readable,
unflagged `server-*.tore-replay` files above the limit, and their companion
logs. Flagged recordings never count toward the limit and are never deleted.
A limit of 0 keeps only flagged recordings. Incomplete, damaged, unreadable
and non-server files are left for the operator. Player recording retention
is unchanged. See [feedback behavior](spec/replay-feedback.md) and
[replay exports](REPLAYS.md#player-feedback-flags).

For Docker, persist the configured replays folder in a volume as well as the
imported data and logs. The default lives under the data volume's `replays/`.
Flagged recordings and incomplete files can grow without a retention limit.

Disk use varies with the mission. See the measured
[12-aircraft recording examples](baselines/replay-feedback.md) for replay and
companion-log sizes, and the inherited per-file size limit.
