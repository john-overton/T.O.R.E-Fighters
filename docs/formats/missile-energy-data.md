Implementation mode, 2026-10-27. The energy model uses public
physical anchors below, with explicitly fitted aerodynamic and motor values.
The physical reference table is `tore-formats::missile_data::REFERENCES`;
the per-store motor and conditional anchors are in `missile_motors::MOTORS`.
Mass and diameter share `dimensions_evidence`; range has `range_evidence`.
These are public facts/estimates and authored game coefficients, not retail
media. [Behaviour](../spec/missile-energy.md) owns the equations; calibration
results belong in [the feature baseline](../baselines/missile-energy.md).

## Fictional and ambiguous stores

The same data-class derivation applies to fictional/game-only weapons:
AA11B uses the agile IR reference (105 kg, 170 mm, 30 km); AAML the heavy radar
reference (500 kg, 380 mm, 150 km); PL10 concept and AEMP1 the radar reference
(175 kg, 200 mm, 50 km). IDs FITTED-AGILE-IR-CLASS,
FITTED-HEAVY-RADAR-CLASS and FITTED-RADAR-CLASS label these agent decisions.
PL10 is not silently changed into the present Chinese infrared missile.

AS15 and airborne AT12 remain **unknown identity**. Their reviewed game
configuration conflicts with current real-world designations (AS15's record
is a small radar AGM; AT12 is an airborne laser weapon). Neither naming nor
shape establishes which real variant was intended. They retain runtime retail weight
and range, with diameter derived by the common class rule. The FALLBACKS data
rows contain only their fitted drag multipliers, calibrated to that retail
range. They do not invent public physical measurements. Next research step:
find a contemporary game manual/developer identification or period variant
sheet tying the exact store to an unambiguous real weapon. The existing
[decoded inventory](fa-weapons.csv) is the single home for those fallback
record values. No public number is invented to fill that gap.

## Per-store motors and class control budgets

Implementation mode, Phase 2.7 of 2026-10-27. John requested class control
budgets, post-burn inert defeat, two-condition A2A fits and class tail floors. The per-store table records
59 profiles. These are game-model fits, not engineering performance claims.
Thrust is fuel mass times effective exhaust divided by phase duration unless
an explicit thrust override is supplied. Burn phase patterns remain fitted
where no phase-resolved measurements exist; their fuel and derived thrust are
refitted. Every profile has controlled-flight seconds from release, independent
of fuel burn and the later removal lifetime.

Nominal motor references, retained for provenance. Phase 2.7 balance fits
may change these motor values; the actual game parameters are in the table
below. AIM9B's sourced 20-second control budget remains unchanged:

- AIM9B guidance is 20 seconds, from [NAVWEPS OP 2309, third revision,
  13 August 1966, section 2-1.1](https://www.scribd.com/document/1041639431/OP-2309-3rd-AIM-9B).
  Section 2-1.6 gives 8,440 lbf seconds over 2.2 seconds. The model uses their
  mean thrust, 17,064.995 N, replacing the older 17,800 N estimate. Constant
  thrust and 2,200 m/s effective exhaust are fitted. Phase 2.6 independently
  fits its fuel fraction; the retained explicit thrust no longer implies fuel.
  The manual's self-destruction rule is not adopted: John's rule leaves an
  unguided body after control expires.
- The nominal AIM9M boost reference is 12,810.878 N for five seconds from [Navy P-825,
  printed p.14-5](https://falcon.blu3wolf.com/Docs/P-825.pdf#page=284).
  X shares M's motor according to the [USAF fact sheet](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104557/aim-9-sidewinder/).
  Effective exhaust and derived fuel remain fitted.
- R440's nominal thrusts/durations and charges use OPEN-R440 above. The nominal
  AGM84A/E sustain thrust uses OPEN-HARPOON; SSN9 uses OPEN-P120. AS7's nominal
  fuel fraction used the cited 289/225 kg loaded/burnout masses. Current fuel
  fractions are fitted, and AGM84E/AS7 phase values were also refitted.
- AIM7's nominal phase durations use Navy P-825; the current fitted values are
  below. Other nominal motor fields were labelled FITTED-PER-STORE. Initial classes are
  short IR, radar boost/sustain, surface and powered strike. Fictional records
  use the same method without changing their game identities.

AIM9B retains its cited 20-second control time. Other budgets are opinionated
game choices. No per-store control time is fitted. The existing class values
remain 20/70/180 seconds for air classes, 600/90/30 for ground classes and
25/70/120 for surface air-target classes. Under the lead's Phase 2.6 permission
to reassign the six difficult ground stores, the agent assigned AS7, AS14,
AS30 and AT12 to a shared ShortGround 30-second class, and AS16 to the existing
600-second long-ground budget named Cruise. These assignments were made before
motor optimization. AGM84E remains Cruise 600. Guidance type, support rules
and the imported path/drag-curve choice are independent: AS16 retains its
normal drag curve; AT12 retains its imported cruise curve.

John's later Phase 2.6 decision explicitly permits fitted per-store fuel,
burn durations and thrust, even when they differ from the nominal motor
references. These are game-balance coefficients, not engineering measurements.
The guarded Phase 2.7 staged search keeps fuel fraction 0.12..0.50 and
base drag 0.5..3. Total burn ends within the fixed class control budget,
including ignition delay. Rocket impulse coefficients are searched over
600..6000 m/s; sustain-only cruise engines use 5000..28000 m/s, an effective
fuel/impulse coefficient rather than rocket exhaust velocity. Booster fuel
share is 0.05..0.98. Phase durations are solved within launch-weight and
53.5 dry-mass g limits, with boost thrust at least sustain thrust.
The older four-coordinate search rescales existing durations and impulse,
but its emitted candidates must pass the same guard. These are agent-authored
calibration bounds, not runtime clamps or measured motor properties.

The shared fitter/verification guard requires boost thrust at least sustain
thrust, at least 8 g initial thrust on launch mass for all A2A and SAM classes,
and at most 54 g peak thrust on dry mass. Ground-class initial thrust floors
are FastGround 4 g, ShortGround 1 g, Command 2 g, and Cruise 4 g with a booster
or 0.25 g for a sustain-only engine. Sustain-only cruise engines do not invent
a zero-thrust booster. Both declared and actual impulse/fuel coefficients must
lie in 400..6600 m/s for rockets, or 4000..32000 m/s for sustain-only cruise
engines. The rocket ceiling leaves 25% headroom to the previous 8800 m/s limit;
the dry-mass ceiling leaves 10% to 60 g. A2A must reach Mach 1 within 3 seconds
from 250 m/s at 5,000 ft, including ignition delay. This standardized probe
uses level launch and an observed stationary point 100 km ahead.

Powered cruise here means the Cruise control class plus the cruise drag curve:
AGM84A, AGM84E, AM39 and SSN9. At each exact reference range they must hit,
remain powered and arrive at Mach 0.60..0.95. That band is an agent-authored
game sanity check. AS16 has the long Cruise control budget but normal drag;
it is not subjected to a subsonic sea-skimmer check. AT12 retains ShortGround.
The retained AGM84A sustain can outlast its control budget, as before. Neither
class times, the defeat rule, guidance nor the runtime force law changed.

Nineteen A2A profiles failed the new shape guard, including the highlighted
PL7, AA8 and AA2 defects. AS16 also failed the ground-store shape guard. The current round therefore refits
those 19 A2A profiles and AS16, AGM84E, AM39 and SSN9. AGM84A also receives
a small sustain-thrust increase to reach its exact reference before control
expiry. Its existing 962-second sustain and 600-second control budget remain.
All SAM data and the six already-valid A2A motors remain unchanged. [The baseline](../baselines/missile-energy.md#motor-shape-audit)
records the before/after motor shapes, acceleration and arrival results.

All 25 A2A stores are checked against the unchanged 35k head anchor and their measured
round-2 5k tail reach. The latter numbers are explicit secondary data from
the round-2 baseline, not newly invented real-world conditions. Shared class
times and the global post-burn Mach 1.0 / 30-tick defeat policy never enter
the optimizer. The remaining ground-role stores fit their existing stationary
reference conditions. SAM targets are airborne at their stated reference
height; airborne ground weapons launch at 1,500 m and 300 m/s, except the
command reference at 100 m and 30 m/s. Ground targets are stationary at 10 m;
surface launch is stationary at 10 m.

The offline search exports candidate data and complete altitude/aspect cells.
It minimizes relative errors with equal priority to head and tail, then
tools/missile_energy_fit.py selects compatible candidates jointly. Modern
AIM120/AA12/MICA must cover AIM7E/AIM7/AA10/R530 at 5k head and tail. Existing
Sparrow, R-27 and short-IR generation checks remain. The selector keeps a
20 m head and 10 m tail margin for the role comparison and a 10 m family
margin to avoid numerical ties. It rejects non-finite/out-of-bounds data.

The Sparrow second targets conflict: newer AIM7's round-2 tail is 5.792 km,
older AIM7E's is 8.061 km. Even perfect fitting cannot put both within 10%
and keep the newer one ahead. The minimum equal-relative-error intersection
is about 6.74 km before other constraints. AIM54C's decoded minimum also
requires more tail reach than its old reference. Other residuals are bounded
search compromises, not proofs of physical impossibility or claims about
real-world variants. [The baseline](../baselines/missile-energy.md) gives
every before/after value, residual and the exact accepted exceptions.

--fit-motors and --fit-staged vary authored motor data with fixed control budgets;
--fit-class is the smaller fuel/drag-only search. Candidate outputs carry the
actual phase thrusts, durations and fuel split. No fitting runs during gameplay.
The ordinary --fit-pair/--fit-sparrow names reject timer fitting; their explicit
--legacy variants remain for historical work. --verify checks both reference
bands and role/family ordering. Its named, bounded exception list prevents
an unlisted overshoot from being silently accepted. The old secondary
references for non-A2A records are comparison data only.

Fuel and drag are fitted in every row. Retained Phase 2.6 means all motor and
drag values in that row are unchanged in Phase 2.7. The impulse coefficient derives thrust only when no explicit
phase-thrust override is present. It is an effective game coefficient, not
a measured exhaust velocity. The data's NOMINAL evidence tags identify the
earlier references, not a claim that the fitted values equal them.

### Sparrow and drag constraints

AIM7 retains the explicit F/M proxy and the fitted 0.5-second ignition delay.
Its motor parameters now belong to the joint Phase 2.6 fit. AIM7 and AIM7E
keep the shared 70-second control class. The baseline reports the conflicting
tail targets and all twelve ordering margins.

There are no drag exceptions in the current data. AS16 and SSN9 are within
0.5..3 along with the other 57 profiles. The shared drag curves and atmosphere
are unchanged, and no supplemental geometry or altitude factor was restored.

## Span reference data

**Reference only.** John removed the geometry-based drag factor after round 3.
Largest deployed spans and span/diameter ratios below do not enter the force
kernel or model fingerprint. Body diameter retains its existing use in frontal
reference area; the physical diameter and mass sources elsewhere are unchanged.
No additional altitude multiplier or fade is applied.

Span means the largest fully deployed wing or fin tip-to-tip dimension. Missing
measurements in the reviewed sources remain unknown. The table retains explicit
agent estimates: ratio 3.0 for strike/cruise, 3.5 for remaining IR or surface
profiles, 3.0 otherwise, plus labelled fictional-family proxies. These are
reference estimates, not recovered or published dimensions and not simulation
inputs. The next evidence step is a variant-specific manufacturer drawing.

## Other fitted fields

The [behaviour specification](../spec/missile-energy.md) owns atmosphere,
force curves, control-speed, loft, seeker, decoy and fuze rules. Diameter
fallback is 0.127*(mass/86)^(1/3) m, limited to 0.07..0.6 m. Public motor data do
not establish seeker identity, gimbal, activation, arming, fuze or damage.
Those retain their reviewed game contracts. No susceptibility is clipped
before evaluating the combined Energy decoy probability.

## Loaded aircraft mass changes

`Weapon::carried_weight_lb` applies public/class mass to carried stores and
loadout totals, for AI and players alike. Decoded `weight` remains intact for old combat rules, effects, the fitted radar-signature weight proxy
and inspection. External-fuel and gun-pod accounting are unchanged. The table
below is pounds per store; aircraft change is the delta times carried quantity.
Surface SAM placeholder weights are included for audit, although aircraft do
not normally carry those stores.
