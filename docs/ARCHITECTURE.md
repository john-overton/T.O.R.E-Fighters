The M0 environment supports the M1a menu slice, the M1b renderer across all 16 theaters, and M1c free flight in twelve aircraft (see the [roster guide](aircraft-import.md)) plus a development weapons range. M0's full title census, salvage inventory, parity specification, and AI VM decision remain open.

These are baseline-compatible versions, not automatically the latest versions. Exact versions live in `Cargo.lock`. See upstream [wgpu 27 documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu/27.0.1/wgpu/) and [winit 0.30 documentation](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.13/winit/) for API contracts.

The shell creates its window on the main event loop and uploads a 640 × 480 RGBA menu canvas to a Metal/native GPU texture. The shader draws a scaled, letterboxed image using linear filtering. The same viewport calculation maps physical mouse coordinates back into retail coordinates, including Retina scaling. It handles zero-sized windows and recoverable surface loss. Fatal graphics/startup errors return a failing process status.

`tore-import` (`crates/tore-import`, standard library and `tore-formats` only, so a server can use it without the windowing, graphics and audio libraries) holds the whole import. Its `media_source.rs` decides what a chosen folder is by its contents: an installed game folder with loose archives, or a disc folder holding the Electronic Arts installer container (`SETUP.ESA`), whose stored archives are read in place by offset rather than copied. `tore-formats::executable` maps the executable's hash to one of the two reviewed builds and supplies that build's table addresses, so the disc's 1.0 build and the 1.02F patch decode the same content; an unknown build is refused before any archive is opened. Its `import.rs` selectively decompresses resources into a versioned local pack and verifies the pack from disk before the import completes, reporting progress by archive and resource count; `pack.rs` reads and writes the pack and loads the newest good one. The game's `assets.rs` calls it and adds what only the game needs: it validates and decodes the menu art, buttons, fonts and debrief art from the loaded resources (the library takes that check as a function, so a set the game cannot draw never reaches the cache). `menu.rs` composites original background, button pieces, and font strips and owns UI state. `renderer.rs` owns the surface, texture, and scaling. Every game object is built from imported assets before the window opens and the renderer needs a terrain world, so a first run cannot happen inside the game application: `main.rs` runs a pre-game shell, a second winit application handler holding `locate.rs` and the blit-only presenter in `canvas_present.rs`, on the same event loop through `run_app_on_demand`. Re-import from Pref ends the game application and runs the shell again; the event loop is created once. `audio.rs` mixes bounded local PCM, recorded music, and up to sixteen spatial voices with linear resampling into the device rate. `tore-sim::acoustics` advances sound wavefronts and passing-object detection at 120 Hz. Combat publishes bounded sound emissions with physical positions; the app uses the main camera as listener and the device mixer supplies stereo direction, distance gain and treble fade. An emission released by the player's own aircraft plays centered and without distance while the listener is in that cockpit; every other outside sound is muffled in a cockpit view. Up to ten looping sources (crash fires, other aircraft's engines) and, in external views, the player's own engine are placed with distance, stereo and Doppler pitch. See [audio behavior](audio.md). Explosions, craters and crash-site fires are drawn by `effect_renderer.rs` from the original sheets as textured sprites ([explosions](spec/explosions.md)). Audio initializes independently and can fail without blocking menus. No input device or microphone is opened.

The app and general extractor share the same EALIB/DCL readers. `Archive::open` reads a directory and seeks to selected resources; it does not load whole disc archives. The menu retains a 16 MiB resource cap; the general CLI has an explicit configurable cap for larger media. The Python entry point handles portable invocation and SHA-256 report enrichment; it contains no second decompressor.

Menu-only startup randomness chooses one of the five native backgrounds independently of future simulation state. The selected background's embedded palette colors shared sprites/fonts, and native bar offsets keep controls aligned. Hover/focus notifications do not enqueue audio.

Menu drawing uses CPU composition for this small static canvas; it is not a commitment to software-rendering flight scenes. The window sleeps while idle. Hover transitions and transient placeholder messages schedule temporary redraws. The fragment shader is authored source; it contains no retail bytes.


`tore-import` retains prior cache generations until a new import is synced and
validated from disk. Successful import and startup load remove older numbered
packs from that cache directory. Cleanup is best effort and does not touch
source media or extracted assets. [Retention contract](spec/import-cache.md).

## Startup diagnostics

`diagnostics.rs` installs a bounded `log` sink and panic hook at the start of
`main`, before preferences, assets and the event loop. Existing wgpu logging
and winit tracing feed the same sink. Startup stages and first presentations
are explicit checkpoints; simulation behavior and adapter choice are unchanged.
`startup.rs` owns unattended-dialog policy and media-free success, failure,
panic and synthetic graphics checks. Main-thread unwinding produces a fatal
report and a nonzero exit rather than resuming gameplay.

`tore-diagnostics-native` is a second narrow audited OS boundary. Its safe API
shows Windows MessageBox/AppKit errors without creating the game renderer and
writes Windows Application events. Linux notifications use an optional bounded
`notify-send` process. The app and simulation retain their unsafe-code ban.
The MSI registers the source against the executable's embedded message table.
The existing platform bindings and `log`/`tracing` dependencies are reused;
there is no additional GUI or logging framework.

`tore-realtime-native` is a third (slice EF-M). On macOS it gives the calling
thread a Mach time-constraint policy and holds an `NSProcessInfo` activity, so
the game's host thread and the dedicated server's loop wake for each 120 Hz
tick on time ([sleep and wait accuracy on each
system](#sleep-and-wait-accuracy-on-each-system-ef-x)); on Linux and Windows
both calls do nothing. It reuses the `objc2` and `objc2-foundation` versions
and features `tore-diagnostics-native` already uses (no new outside crate), and
not AppKit, so the headless server does not link it.

File paths, retention, fallbacks and failure limits have one home in the
[startup diagnostics contract](spec/startup-diagnostics.md). Release packages
exercise the actual staged and extracted executable; desktop installation
acceptance remains separate.

## Boundaries for menu work

Keep `tore-formats` independent of windowing and GPU APIs. The future simulation likewise needs to run headlessly with deterministic inputs. Avoid empty placeholder crates or premature engine abstractions.

Menu rendering should consume decoded palettes, indexed images, font data, and recovered layout geometry. Recover specifications from the TypeScript reference; implement runtime behavior in Rust. Do not introduce a web shell, copy the Three.js engine, or select a modern widget toolkit before checking retail geometry requirements.

Import user-owned media at runtime into platform application data. The v1 pack is a development cache of selected decompressed resources, not a stable mod/save format. `gameassets/` is a local source-media convenience, not a runtime bundle or save-data location. See [menu formats](formats/menu.md) for the current limits and provenance.

## First simulation renderer

World image pages share a bounded 1024-square array, with sixteen logical pages
per layer. `static_art.rs` retains large scenery pictures at source resolution
and clips face geometry at page boundaries. Material-local storage metadata
keeps rectangular aircraft/smoke images and paged world/weather art distinct.
All sample, palette-remap and shadow paths use the corresponding addressing.
[Source coverage and static variant composition](spec/terrain-detail.md).

`terrain.rs` (in `tore-world`) builds `Terrain` from the selected retail MM and its resolved T2: the grid, the airport scene and the weather clock, with the height, surface and wind queries the simulation uses. It holds no art and reads no environment variable. `scenery.rs` builds `Scenery` from the same resources and the finished `Terrain`: the named or numbered texture references, DAY2 variant palette, terrain mesh, sky art, static airport geometry and per-camera weather. Neither has a GPU or window dependency. `sim_renderer.rs` uploads geometry and a texture array, owns depth targets and draws terrain plus a fullscreen sky pass; `terrain.wgsl` supplies the initial perspective, sampling and fog. `renderer.rs` composes this scene with the transparent CPU HUD, resizing depth and surface together. This separation allows aircraft/object/weather passes and a deterministic simulation to be added without coupling format readers to wgpu.

The initial implementation uses full-resolution fixed triangles and an authored sky/fog projection. It is not the native adaptive renderer. All geometry/colors come from local source data at runtime; no retail derivatives are embedded. See [theater findings](formats/theater.md) for recovered versus authored behavior. The Hornet adapter now advances at 120 fixed ticks/second; the developer free camera still uses elapsed wall time for inspection.

The creator selects among all 16 base theaters. Scene replacement rebuilds the GPU vertex/texture buffers for that world; a variable texture-array layer count also supplies the sky shader's layer index. Only the active world mesh is built, while the bounded source bundle remains cached. Maps and fonts stay in the menu compositor. Source text shading is preserved when tinting; ARMFont/SMLFONT replace the unsuitable BODYFONT in the investigation UI and notices.

The Hornet slice adds dependency resolution and bounded BRF/SH/FNT readers to `tore-formats`. `tore-sim::flight` contains fixed-tick state/integration without wgpu/winit dependencies; the app re-exports its interface; `aircraft.rs` adapts imported geometry and camera poses, and holds `Airframe`, which wraps the simulation's `AircraftType` (`aircraft_type.rs` in `tore-world`: the imported profile, flight model, sensors and engine outlet points, with no art) beside the drawn half. `instruments.rs` renders independent small rasters from flight/equipment state, each framed by the aircraft's own original instrument window picture (named by its HUD) and coloured every frame through the live cockpit palette, as the cockpit art is; page content draws in coordinates relative to the 138×114 screen ([bezel spec](spec/instrument-bezel.md)). The GPU terrain pass now accepts an aircraft vertex stream and original rectangular atlas with shared depth; front/other instrument cameras render offscreen. CLI extraction and cache import share the same dependency resolver. These adapters do not execute imported x86 modules. See [aircraft evidence and open questions](formats/aircraft.md).

`surface_lighting.rs` owns three geometric shadow maps and the shared light
uniform. `surface_lighting.wgsl` supplies continuous diffuse response, solar
warmth, orientation-dependent fill, painted-panel highlights, cloud transmission
and shadow sampling to terrain, aircraft and weapon
surfaces; sky/cloud shaders share its solar tint helper. Opaque batches enter
the shadow pass before the world pass. Partial sunrise/sunset uses the solid
disc's visible area and segment centroid for direct light and shadow direction.
Manually filtered depth neighbors each use receiver-plane correction and
continuous blocker weights. The bounded penumbra filter combines caster
distance with smooth camera-distance antialiasing. Terrain has a separate
stream of area-weighted shared normals for lighting; shadow depth still uses
actual triangles. Smooth sky, glare and shadow directions share fractional
weather-clock time. Sun-disc strength and geometric visibility are independent
of the sunglare toggle. Terrain alone reduces low-sun ambient fill on unexposed
slopes; exposed ridges, aircraft and water retain their existing response. Smooth aircraft geometry is complete,
including faces hidden from the camera, and hiding the player in cockpit view
does not remove its shadow caster. Material layer -6 identifies emissive combat
effects and -7 identifies textured flame sheets. Glass and flame sheets do not
cast solid shadows; ordinary cutout surfaces cast only their opaque texels. Stepped
mode retains palette lighting and camera face rejection. See the
[surface specification](spec/surface-lighting.md) for fitted limits.



`flight_views.rs` resolves manual-described camera relations from read-only flight,
combat and wing snapshots. The camera rig owns only presentation state: the
reference, last player missile, fixed fly-by position and saved Other View.
Weather, spatial audio, main rendering and the Other View panel use the same
camera rules. Remote aircraft/missile interior cameras hide the reference body without removing
it from simulation. A replay builds the same scene from recorded poses, and any
aircraft can be the reference. [Behavior and fitted constants](spec/flight-views.md).

`flight_ui.rs` owns desktop command dispatch, the imported menu's flight actions, session presentation settings and pause state; the menu's navigation, hit geometry and drawing are `pause_menu.rs`, shared with the replay viewer. `hud.rs` draws the forward-flight HUD from state and source font glyphs, projecting the ladder/path through the renderer's 60-degree camera convention. Simulation remains independent of both. The full-canvas cockpit is transparent art over the world; instrument windows are independent rasters. Menu/focus pauses stop fixed ticks and engine loops, and input transitions clear held controls. Shader zoom is shared by terrain and sky projection; camera previews restore the main camera before drawing.


`flight_canvas.rs` now composes the flight-only overlay at an aspect-responsive size (physical drawable, proportionally capped at 1920×1080). The separate GPU cockpit pass preserves uniform cover-fit in the centered forward view, and instrument layout rectangles anchor to actual edges. Native instrument rasters go directly to their destination sizes instead of passing through a reduced 640×480 composite. The original cockpit texture is uploaded once; unchanged scaled panel rasters are cached. Alpha-aware filtering prevents dark transparent borders. `renderer.rs` recreates its UI texture when dimensions change and uses the full viewport for flight; menus/viewer overlays retain their existing canvas. Pointer conversion uses the same responsive panel rectangles, while the centered pause menu retains menu coordinates. HUD metadata uses a 0.7225 layout scale, including the requested additional 15% reduction. Projection compensation preserves angular cues through resizing and portrait aspect.

`tore_sim::autopilot` owns captured heading/altitude, mode and an optional
world-space navigation target. `State::step_surface` consumes mode switches,
applies pilot override and generates control deflections before the selected
flight adapter runs. The HUD reads this state. See the
[autopilot specification](spec/autopilot.md).

### Flight presentation and measurement

`flight::State` remains authoritative at 120 Hz. `main` retains the preceding tick for render-only pose interpolation (shortest-path wrapped angles); pause/crash show authoritative state and restart resets history. Camera, exterior geometry and HUD consume the same presented pose. Everything else combat draws is captured once per tick, after the AI step, as a plain-data `RenderSnapshot` (`snapshot.rs`, which holds the pose types, the devices, `interpolate` and `blend`, and no drawing code): other aircraft with their devices, damage and wreck state, fixtures, weapons, effects, debris and ejected pilots, plus the player's own pose. Combat keeps the last two snapshots (`previous_snapshot`, `render_snapshot`), and the app's `CombatView` (`combat_view.rs`) holds the frame's tick fraction and blends them; the main view, mirrors and camera panels draw that blend through the shared `aircraft_batches` and `combat_geometry` helpers of `render_snapshot.rs` (the vertex building, with `CombatArt` and the afterburner light helpers), with the art and the other aircraft's models from the view, which a mission replay uses to draw a recording, so both show the same picture. Each pose also carries whether its afterburner flame lights the scene; the shared `afterburner_glow`, `target_glows` and `engine_outlets` helpers turn those into lights at the presented poses. Chaff and flares are not part of the snapshot: live flight hands the countermeasure renderer the combat state's devices, and a replay the same devices flown again from their recorded releases (`replay/devices.rs`). `replay/convert.rs` turns each snapshot, plus flight data it does not carry, into a `tore-replay` frame and a decoded frame back into a snapshot; a synthetic round-trip test draws both through the shared helpers and requires every vertex within the format's 1/64 ft position precision. Reset clears that history. AI gear, flap, hook, brake, bay, exhaust and control-surface samples use that
same render fraction; an aircraft whose AI stopped flying holds its last
devices, and fixtures retain their fixed devices. Audio consumes
authoritative state. No renderer smoothing feeds back into physics.

World camera depth uses `Depth32Float`, storing the near plane at depth 1 and
the far plane at depth 0. Using the near and far distances, the vertex shader computes clip Z as
`near * (far - view_z) / (far - near)`, then perspective division yields depth.
Depth clears to zero and nearer fragments compare greater. The existing near
plane and 2,200,000-foot far limit remain. Aircraft, terrain, static objects,
clouds, smoke, vapor, chaff, flares, flare glare and the spotting aid use
this same mapping. The separate
orthographic shadow maps keep their existing depth convention. This is an
agent-selected host correction for distant surface flicker; see
[NVIDIA's depth-precision analysis](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/visualizing-depth-precision/).

Theaters are about a million feet across, where a 32-bit float steps 1/8 foot,
so aircraft built in world coordinates snapped a little differently every
frame and shimmered in exterior views. Camera positions are kept in f64, and
each frame `Scenery::set_origin` picks a render origin: the camera position
snapped to a 1,024-foot grid, shared by every camera that frame. Aircraft,
ejected pilots, weapons, debris, tracers and effects are built relative to it
(`Scenery::local`), and the scene uniform carries the origin and the camera's
exact offset from it. `object_vertex` and `shadow_object_vertex` place those
vertices through the offset; terrain and airports stay in world coordinates
and reach the camera through the origin, so only their own storage rounding
remains. Smoke, vapor and countermeasures stay in world coordinates. An origin
of zero reproduces world-coordinate vertices exactly. Target-window framing
converts those relative mesh vertices back to world positions before fitting
them against its world-space camera.

Active simulation views request the next redraw without a post-render timer; AutoVsync and a requested maximum frame latency of one provide presentation backpressure. Idle menu behavior is unchanged. Failed/zero-size presentation does not continually schedule simulation redraws. `performance.rs` provides opt-in bounded CPU wall-time sampling via environment variables, with warmup exclusion and view cycling.

The GPU cockpit texture survives view and size changes; projection uniforms track the current aspect. Aircraft GPU resources are prepared when the renderer/theater loads. Live camera panels submit bounded asynchronous readbacks (at most one pending per camera page), consume completed rasters on later frames, and retain their last image while pending. The simulation renderer caches world-pass attachments (depth, multisampled colour and the render-scale image) for up to five output sizes, so the display, mirrors and 138×114 panels do not reallocate at every refresh. World pipelines live together in `sim_renderer::Pipelines` and are rebuilt when the anti-aliasing sample count changes. After the world pass, an optional resample pass scales the render-scale image to the output, and the spotting-aid pass draws single-sampled outlines using the world depth; `graphics.rs` holds the options and the [graphics options](spec/graphics-options.md) page specifies them. Offline captures retain an explicit blocking readback so smoke evidence contains the requested image. Direct GPU panel composition, full GPU UI rendering and native terrain LOD remain future optimization work.

`look.rs` owns authored held-key classification, look limits and exterior spherical orbit. Shift arrows are isolated from flight input and retain their look classification until physical release, including after modifier changes; Ctrl arrows, FA's thrust vectoring, do nothing yet. Camera motion uses elapsed presentation time while unpaused. Internal elevation is limited to the forward eye line through overhead; exterior orbit keeps a fixed radius and aims at the same interpolated aircraft pose. It does not alter simulation state or synchronously capture the GPU.

### The frame loop under load

Every rendered flight frame turns the wall time since the last frame into
simulation ticks: `flight::Clock::steps_scaled` clamps the elapsed time to
0.25 s, multiplies it by the time compression (0.5x to 8x; the `C` key steps
1x, 2x, 4x, 8x), and cuts it into 120 Hz ticks, carrying the remainder. The
frame then runs **every one of those ticks, stepping the mission and
presenting each, before it draws anything**. There is no cap on the ticks a
frame may run. John decided on 2026-10-02 to keep it that way: a cap would
keep the picture moving at a minimum rate, but the rate reached would fall
short of the one chosen, which a player would see as time running slow.

What that means under load, by the loop's arithmetic:

- A tick that costs `c` seconds of wall time keeps up at time compression `K`
  while `120 * K * c`, plus the drawing, stays under one second per second.
  At 8x that is under about 1 ms a tick.
- Past that the frames grow, until the 0.25 s clamp holds them. A frame then
  runs at most 240 ticks at 8x (120 at 4x, 60 at 2x, 30 at 1x), takes
  `240 * c` plus the drawing, and the rate reached is the 2 s of mission time
  it buys divided by its wall time: `2 / (240 * c + draw)` at 8x. An average
  tick of 4 ms holds 8x down to about 2x.
- A single slow tick is a hitch in one frame, and at 8x the same slow tick
  comes eight times as often in wall time. That is how the firing estimate
  below showed worst at 8x.

Measured on 2026-10-02 (agent PF1b; Ryzen 9 7900X, 64 GB, RTX 4070, release
build, one window, no audio; the Hornet with the AIM-120 selected and the
nearest target designated; three runs of each, before and after taken
alternately; `TORE_PERF_FRAMES` with [its "simulated:"
line](DEVELOPMENT.md#flight-performance)). The default Quick Mission is two
AI aircraft; the heavy one is `--launch-quick-mission --probe-fight 15:15`
(29 AI aircraft). "Sim+cam" is the report's simulation-and-cameras time per
frame, the ticks plus the camera panels, in milliseconds.

| Mission, asked for | Build | Rate reached | Frames a second | Sim+cam mean | Sim+cam worst frame |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default, 1x | before | 1.00x | 66.7 (66.5 to 66.9) | 1.87 | 41 (40 to 41) |
| Default, 1x | after | 1.00x | 67.3 (65.5 to 68.3) | 1.68 | 26 (21 to 35) |
| Default, 8x | before | 8.00x | 61.7 (61.7 to 61.9) | 2.67 | 115 (112 to 116) |
| Default, 8x | after | 8.00x | 62.7 (62.2 to 63.2) | 2.51 | 34 (33 to 34) |
| Heavy, 1x | before | 1.00x | 54.5 (53.9 to 54.8) | 7.52 | 52 (52 to 52) |
| Heavy, 1x | after | 1.00x | 55.8 (55.5 to 56.1) | 7.37 | 34 (33 to 35) |
| Heavy, 8x | before | 7.72x | 55.3 (55.1 to 55.4) | 11.45 | 623 (623 to 623) |
| Heavy, 8x | after | 7.79x | 55.2 (54.2 to 55.8) | 11.40 | 553 (551 to 554) |

The heavy 8x runs are the long ones (about 38 s of wall time, about five
minutes of mission); a shorter set over the first minute or so reached 6.92x
before and 7.14x after. The 550 to 640 ms frame in every heavy 8x run, before
and after, fits a clamp frame (240 ticks at about 2.3 ms); the range estimate
does not cause it.

Neither mission reached the 0.25 s clamp for long, and the rate at 8x was
never lower than at 2x or 4x. PF1's earlier report was a heavy mission at 8x
reaching only about 3.5x at about 4 frames a second after its first minute,
and 8x slower than 2x was not reproduced in its 72 runs. These runs did not
reproduce the 3.5x either, on the same mission and the same code before the
change; they differ by running without audio, so the cause of a rate below
2x, if one exists, is still unexplained. It would take a tick costing more
than 4 ms on average.

#### The firing estimate and its exact shortcuts

While a missile is selected and a target is designated, each ownship works out
the weapon's maximum range and favourable firing band every 60 ticks
(`maximum_range` and `firing_band` in `tore-sim/src/combat/missiles.rs`,
called from the combat step). Both fly trial missiles through `intercept`, the
same 120 Hz fly-out the guidance uses, about twenty trials in all, each up to
the weapon's whole flight (an AIM-120 about 3,600 ticks, an AIM-54 about
10,200). PF1 measured that at 37 ms for one tick (AIM-120, default mission) to
100 ms (AIM-54): a hitch every half second of mission time, every 62 ms of wall
time at 8x.

Three shortcuts skip only trials whose answer is already fixed, so every
number the player sees is the same, bit for bit:

| Shortcut | Why the answer cannot change |
| --- | --- |
| `maximum_range` does not fly a distance that the missile and the target cannot close within the weapon's whole flight (`travel_ceiling`: the speed the motor could reach with all its thrust spent in a line, the coast slowdown, the largest sag or ejection speed, and the target's own speed) | `intercept` succeeds only once the closest approach is within 25 ft, and a tick closes the gap by no more than the two objects move; the old code flew the whole trial to answer no |
| `firing_band` stops a trial once a hit could no longer score 70 (a binary search for the latest hit time that still scores 70) | the band uses only `score >= 70`, and a later hit never scores higher than an earlier one |
| `intercept` checks every 16 ticks while the missile coasts whether the gap is more than missile and target can still close, and stops with the answer it would have reached, no hit | out of fuel the missile only slows (a turn costs speed, the coast slowdown takes it), its sag is capped, and the target keeps its speed (`coasting_reach`) |

Each bound carries a small rounding margin (`unreachable`). The tests in
`missile_tests.rs` hold every shortcut to the old code: whole copies of the
old `maximum_range`, `firing_band` and `intercept` run beside the new ones on
random missiles, speeds, distances, motions, ages, sag, ejection and cruise
profiles, and must agree to the last bit. The cases include late hits the
bounds must not cut off, and a built case where only the fall of a coasting
missile reaches the target. A bound made 10% too small, or one that forgets
the sag, fails them. The work is bounded without timing:
`a_range_estimate_flies_a_bounded_number_of_ticks` counts the ticks
`intercept` flew (a counter compiled only into test builds) for a fixed set of
three missiles and six targets, and fails above 1,500,000 ticks. It flies
1,231,686; the old code flew 2,187,517, so a change that brings the cost back
goes over the bound. The shortcuts cut the ticks flown by about 44 percent.

The worst frame in the table is the estimate's cost: 41 to 26 ms and 115 to
34 ms in the default mission at 1x and 8x, and 52 to 34 ms in the heavy one at
1x. The mean frame improved by 0.1 to 0.2 ms and the rate reached did not
change within the spread, because the estimate is one tick in sixty.

### Continuous attitude and momentum

`attitude.rs` supplies body bases, Rodrigues rotation, orthonormalization, and render interpolation. `flight::State` retains separate world velocity and pitch/roll response rates. The old pitch clamp and nose-derived position update are removed. Force integration and attitude response remain deterministic at 120 Hz; render interpolation does not feed back. `look` uses the same body basis for head rotation, while exterior orbit retains aircraft-centered inspection behavior. The HUD flight-path marker projects actual velocity bearing/elevation.

`cockpit_renderer.rs` and `cockpit.wgsl` project the complete original forward artwork and the 640×480 HUD raster through one aircraft-fixed plane. Relative eye/body axes move both layers together during head-look, independently of aircraft attitude. The pass draws after the world and before screen-anchored instruments/menus, including offline captures; camera instrument readbacks exclude it. A cached source-size glass mask follows the cockpit transform and clips the HUD when cockpit art is visible. The shader composites masked HUD behind cockpit art and mirror contents; cockpit-off/wide view bypasses the glass mask. Linear premultiplied sampling preserves transparent borders. HUD uploads and uniforms are nonblocking; resize does not rebuild the source texture. The sky shader projects SKY0 onto a finite hemisphere disk with `ray.xz / (1 + max(ray.y, 0))`, avoiding the latitude/longitude singularity and seam at zenith. Native sky mapping and full 3D cockpit geometry remain unimplemented; the projected source plane has finite coverage and cannot provide a rear/overhead interior.

The shared hybrid adapter and its recovered-versus-fitted boundaries are specified in [FLIGHT-MODEL.md](FLIGHT-MODEL.md). Scalars resolve once when constructing the aircraft-owned typed configuration; immutable model data are shared by presentation snapshots and envelope queries allocate no temporary hit vectors. Renderer-specific Hornet animation tests remain in the app.

Aircraft-specific fitted laws live in `tore-sim::models::{f18,rafale_c}`, selected
through `AircraftModel` and the `FlightModel` interface. Each owns independent
validated configuration covering mass, propulsion, envelopes, recovered departure/contact limits, equipment response and tuning. `State` holds the selected model; `Research` holds only evolving departure/contact/clock state. Updates take no raw aircraft argument. Integration and recovered algorithms are shared components.
`tore-sim::telemetry` exposes gauge-independent air/ground/altitude channels with
explicit units and unavailable sensor readings; analog gauge presentation must
remain downstream of this interface. See [model extension guide](FLIGHT-MODEL.md).
`State::trace` keeps a write-only `FlightTrace` of the last step's values and
applied effects with their causes, for the telemetry panel and replay logs;
nothing in the simulation reads it and it takes no part in state equality
([telemetry record](FLIGHT-MODEL.md#telemetry-record)).

## Shared physical input

Replay drone controls use an app-owned `tore-input::Resolver` with the drone
catalog entries and the saved profile. Replay keyboard/mouse assignments have
separate device names, so editing them cannot remove flight bindings. The host
routes normalized device events to the viewer and clears holds on focus or
device loss. These controls move only the presentation camera, not the sim.
See [replay controls](INPUT.md#replay-viewer-shortcuts).

`tore-input` is a dependency-free safe Rust crate for physical control bindings,
calibration, per-source contribution/ownership, context release rules, typed pilot
frames and bounded input tapes. `tore-sim` consumes those frames at 120 Hz and no
longer interprets keyboard names. Aircraft configuration and control response stay
in the respective model modules. The app translates keyboard/menu actions and
routes instrument focus to the existing stock controls.

`tore-input-native` owns a dedicated bounded device worker: Linux evdev/rumble,
Windows raw-controller readings/Gamepad vibration, and macOS GameController/
CoreHaptics plus generic HID queues. Apple gamepad input and haptics share the same
retained controller; public HID support queries suppress duplicate raw endpoints. It and the diagnostics boundary
permit audited unsafe platform FFI; `libc` and `windows` are thin platform bindings,
not a third-party input policy engine. Main-loop discovery never blocks a flight
frame. Presentation-only look resolution cannot change pilot-axis ownership.
It also runs the head-tracker receiver: a safe `std::net` loopback UDP socket on
its own thread that reads opentrack poses. Head and mouse look add to the
presented look angle only; they never touch pilot axes or the simulation.
See [contracts, platform limits and profile syntax](INPUT.md).

The app's input configuration screen (`controls_editor`) is one component opened
from the main menu and the paused flight menu. It owns a draft
`tore-input::Profile`; native capture is isolated from menu/gameplay dispatch.
`input_catalog` is the single table of listed actions and stock keyboard/mouse
assignments; it drives the screen's rows, stock-key remapping (`disable`
directives) and the generated [controls master list](CONTROLS.md). Canonical serialization validates
before file replacement and live rebaselining. General display/instrument/sound
preferences use a separate bounded versioned file and persist independently of
flight/aircraft state. Smoke/capture/performance diagnostics bypass those preferences.
Afterburner feedback combines a renewable finite low rumble with the engagement
impulse; context loss cancels both, without changing authoritative flight state.

## Manual combat and systems

`tore-sim::combat::live` owns the deterministic manual range at 120 Hz. Typed
configuration resolves each supported PT’s loadout, SEE/ECM equipment and damage
table once; mutable ammo, projectiles, hit points, subsystem counts and
adapter RNG remain in state (per ownship for the aircraft's own fields, see
[Combat: one ownship per human-flown aircraft](#combat-one-ownship-per-human-flown-aircraft)). Contacts are no longer its own: it holds a
`tore-sim::sensors` live state, feeds it ownship pose, equipment state and the
observable targets each tick, and asks it whether a specific target is supported
before a radar weapon launches. Physical airborne presence is separate from
destroyed combat state, so hit points reaching zero does not erase a return.
`combat::systems` contains bounded translations of
reviewed ECM probability and damage-selection helpers. Unknown native subsystem
side effects remain explicit gaps; the service reproduces combat behaviour rather
than reconstructing the original executable's combat tick.

`combat::ledger` records every projectile from its first step to its outcome
(hit with damage, missed, spoofed by a decoy, jammed), keyed by shooter,
intended target and retail weapon class, plus credited kills and each target's
last attacker. Nothing in flight reads it. The evaluator in `tore_world::debrief`
turns it into a report, and the app's `debrief.rs` keeps the screen that draws
the post-mission pages; `ai_wings.rs` (in `tore-world`) supplies the intended target of AI gun rounds and
reports decoyed missiles. See the [debrief spec](spec/debrief.md).

`combat::gunsight` supplies a renderer-independent fixed-step gun solution using
live projectile speed/drop helpers and current radar observations. `weapon_hud`
draws its pipper/range arc and projects a selected target into a square or edge
chevron. Combat retains a separate display-only target identity through sensor
loss; this never substitutes for `sensors` launch support or radar observations.
[Behavior and evidence](spec/gunsight-targeting.md).

`ai::gunnery` uses the same trajectory solver with explicitly permitted visual
or sensor observations. The controller chooses gun tracking through ordinary
flight inputs and authorizes individual rounds. `ai_wings` rechecks barrel
alignment after flight movement, debits one round only when emitting it, and
launches along the mounted forward axis. Shared live combat applies dispersion
and collision, excluding the shooter. See [gun employment](spec/ai-gun-employment.md).


The app merges independent keyboard/controller trigger holds, dispatches explicit
commands and consumes confirmed events for instruments, graphics, audio and the
bounded feedback mixer. Two-control modifier bindings consume their base controls
and require neutral release across layer/context changes. Native feedback errors
disable that device’s feedback until reconnect; finite leases and context stops
bound rumble. Combat notices reuse the existing HUD line and expire in simulation
ticks, so pause does not age them or expand overlay composition work.

Version-3 combat tapes record service inputs including jammer state, the player
sensor controls (channel, display range and history) and explicit fixture
commands; a designation is recorded by stable target identity, never by screen
coordinate. Replays validate identity/assets and reproduce combat state,
including adapter RNG and subsystem failures. Version-2 tapes still replay with
the default sensor controls; version 1 rejects explicitly. This
is combat-service determinism: it reproduces combat state, not a full application
replay. See [contracts, validation and limitations](baselines/weapons-systems.md).

## Additional aircraft

The aircraft registry includes F-14D, A-4E, X-31 EFM and the seven
[roster additions](spec/roster-aircraft.md). Each owns a typed
model configuration; presentation rigs remain in tore-app. Shared combat resolves
the selected identity's sensors by parsed record channel, never by aircraft name,
and reads its PT stations. Audio switching clears old
aircraft voices. See [aircraft behavior](spec/additional-aircraft.md).

The optional user-supplied [engine material](spec/engine-material.md) replaces reviewed burner
face materials at runtime. Its throttle glow is separate from the retail atlas
and does not change A-4E presentation or flame geometry.

Researched flight is now the default; `--legacy-flight` preserves the previous
model. HUD and audio share the [stall warning signal](spec/stall-warnings.md),
including the original imported warning samples.

Aircraft-owned exterior fits for the seven roster additions live in
`roster_animation.rs`, with reviewed source branch membership in
`additional_animation.rs`. The [animation contract](spec/aircraft-animation.md)
defines their presentation. F-22 bay fraction advances at the shared 120 Hz;
the renderer interpolates it, and manual combat can request it without changing
launch eligibility. Exterior canopy grading is a mesh material, independent
of cockpit artwork and world-view rendering. Its nearest surface is resolved
in a depth-only pass, then blended at 75% opacity over the opaque scene.

## Shared sensor boundary

`tore-sim::sensors` is one component serving all twelve imported aircraft. There
is no aircraft-specific radar code: `profile` normalizes each PT's own SEE and
ECM records into typed capability profiles resolved by parsed signature channel,
`signature` holds the single observer-relative aspect function, `detection` holds
the authored range model, `track` holds the live state (current observations, one
selected target, at most one acquired fire-control track across radar and
infrared, bounded history and received interference), and `passive` collects
received emitters for the exposure instrument. An unreviewed radar or ECM record
is an import error rather than a silent substitution.

The component decides what is observable and whether a specific target is
supported for a radar weapon. `tore-app::scope` only reprojects those shared
observations for drawing and picking, so the page cannot make a hidden target
selectable, and one projection serves both drawing and the mouse pick.
`instruments.rs` draws pages 9 and 0 from that input. Player controls (channel,
display range, history) travel as a per-tick input, which is why the combat tape
reproduces them. The flight adapters and renderer independence are unchanged.
[What is modelled, what is authored tuning and what is deferred](radar.md);
[what was validated](baselines/radar.md).

Missile profiles and the fitted finite-boost motion predictor live in
`combat::missiles`, independent of rendering. Its 120 Hz prediction shares live
lead steering, turn limits, maneuver losses and propulsion. The live adapter
refreshes the bounded maximum-range search at 2 Hz per selected observed target. The live adapter uses full release
velocity for accepted missile profiles; compatibility retains scalar source
motion. Explicit target role is separate from damage category. Launch-origin
minimum-range qualification persists through terminal closure, as specified in
[engagement rules](spec/missiles.md#minimum-engagement-and-target-role). Combat tape version 4 includes world velocity and bay permission, while versions 2 and 3
select compatibility rules. [Missile specification](spec/missiles.md).

Combat tape version 5 records radar power separately from transmission, preserving
passive-channel behavior and radar-off unguided releases. Versions before 5 imply
power on for the new guidance gate. Version 4 remains the missile rule-version boundary. Seeker mode and
controlled target heat/emission changes are recorded commands; seeker observations
and acquisition are reproduced from those inputs, the matching asset fingerprint
and terrain. `--combat-command compatibility-weapons` explicitly selects the old
weapon adapter. Flight adapter selection is independent. Fitted seeker synthesis
consumes the mounted-seeker amplitude and never controls acquisition. A tape does
not record the mission wind or the host turning a crashed flight into a dead
player: a replay is given the theater's wind, so smoke and countermeasures drift
as they did live, but a session in which the flight crashed replays with the
player alive.

`ai::damage` reads live component failures and proposes recovery and control
restrictions. `AiActor` latches the recovery commitment, uses the existing
landing path, and applies protective throttle commands to every real flight
path. The diagnostic damage trace is write-only. Dummies bypass these decisions
and flight stepping. Fire enters the existing per-pilot ejection monitor.
[Contract](spec/systems-damage.md#ai-pilot-response-to-faults).

Quick Mission launches AI wings by default; `--fixture-wings` retains the
straight-flight compatibility path. `Combat::mission_aircraft` retains the six
wing groups and their fitted spawn poses for restart. `AiWings` builds actors
after reset. AI emits aircraft inputs and the flight model alone advances
its pose; no steering pose overwrite follows physics. The bridge mirrors results into `combat::live::Target` for sensors,
rendering and damage. Each wing follows its own current leader from the shared
world snapshot ([lead succession](#lead-succession)); a human-flown aircraft
remains outside the AI actor list and is one world object in that snapshot.
`ai::awareness` owns timestamped current observations and frozen aircraft memory
for each actor. Only current observations enter target selection, weapon geometry
and firing; lost hostile records enter a separate controller search input. The
AI lookout is skill-filtered independently of imported player sensor
profiles, with six timed body directions and attention to a last measured point, and the mission terrain query masks visual and radar/infrared sensing.
Production sensor loading fails explicitly rather than enabling the sensorless
synthetic-fixture path. SEARCHING/ACQUIRING/REJOINING are simulation activities
read by Target view. [Behavior and limitations](spec/ai-awareness.md).
`combat::threats` owns bounded missile observations for every receiver, including
the player RWR. Controllers consume copied threat records through `ai::defense`;
they cannot inspect live missiles or private launcher targets. `ActorSupport`
snapshots bind each guided projectile to its own launcher, and the shared
seeker lifecycle supplies actual pitbull and support-loss state. Countermeasure
bursts are scheduled/debited by the mission before the bridge applies decoy
rolls. RWR drawing reads the same records and never drives the decision clock.
`ai::incoming_fire` observes gun rounds through the pilot's lookout and terrain
query. It retains only consecutive visual samples, anonymous close passes and
weapon-hit cues, never a hidden shooter identity. The app forwards victim-only
combat hit events, and copied round positions before the mission step. The
mission compares fire and missile urgency and supplies one `DefenseMotion` to
the controller. Gunfire does not request devices; valid missile bursts continue
through the existing scheduler. [Contract](spec/visual-awareness-under-fire.md).
`ai::engagement` gates current target selection by role and stance before B41
ranking. Quick Mission initializes a separate neutral engagement gate for every
actor. Accepted combat orders release it; formation and disengage commands
recall it without rewriting mission objectives. Recall suppresses repeated
offensive reactions to known projectile IDs while retaining missile evasion.
AI leaders release neutral wing members after a perceived attack or a current
hostile contact allowed by their mission. Recall prevents contact-only release;
existing individual orders survive an automatic wing release. Commands are
delivered after all same-tick decisions. `AiMission` delivers perception-only attack reports to assigned escorts and wing leaders
on the next tick, with a fixed expiry; bearings never become synthetic targets.
Escorts also assess detected aircraft against each assigned friendly's protection
zone using observed relative motion. Confirmed attackers outrank prospective
threats. Frozen contacts can guide investigation but still cannot authorize fire.
Quick Mission group objectives resolve through stable side/wing/member metadata
into per-actor assignments. Whole-group survival requirements are stored separately from combat orders.
The Target window combines player assignments, these requirements and allegiance
to select a typed Survive/Destroy label, with no label for other contacts. Source missions and
campaign outcomes remain outside the M1 assignment adapter.
`ai::formation` owns routine repositioning, trailing, breakout, intercept, stabilization and
capture guidance. Traffic and arrival states are snapshotted before any actor
advances, so iteration order cannot grant approach priority. Its trace hook is
read-only; optional host CSV logging is described in
[development diagnostics](DEVELOPMENT.md#formation-flight-traces). The formation
choice and placement are specified in [mission wings](spec/quick-mission-menu.md#mission-wings).
`ai::thought` holds the write-only [AI thinking record](REPLAYS.md#ai-thinking-record): controller and actor traces of each tick, a log of random draws, and a message journal the host drains once per tick through `AiWings::take_ai_journal`; no decision reads them, and golden fingerprints prove the AI behaves exactly as without them.
Rendering groups targets by imported airframe, with a cached
texture binding per identity and vertex buffers that grow to fit the formation.
The player's atlas is never substituted for another type. Fixed-step timing and
the three player flight adapters are unchanged. Normal flight loads supported default stores;
restricted native research flight keeps its clean configuration.

`combat::smoke` owns bounded, fixed-step puff histories independently of rendering
and guidance. The app supplies engine outlet positions once per combat tick;
contrails retain two minutes of history in a separate 72,000-puff budget.
[Smoke and contrail rules](spec/damage-smoke.md) define rates, size and fade.
The app's smoke pass retains original indexed smoke artwork and resolves it
through each camera's current weather palette and haze remaps. Clouds and smoke
share directional sunset lighting and air/cloud occlusion. It sorts keyed
billboards for each camera, blends them without depth writes, and depth-tests
against the world. It culls offscreen puffs without deleting their history,
then uploads one 24-byte instance per visible puff; the vertex shader builds
its six billboard vertices. Age and expiry remain fixed-step CPU state.
Coverage is premultiplied only after lighting to preserve transparent edges.
Gun release dispersion is sampled once in the shared fixed-step projectile
path using a stable projectile-identity hash. Cannons release individual physical
bullets at a fixed-step cadence; every third bullet draws one tracer ribbon,
without a duplicate projectile mesh. Ribbons follow the actual swept segments. A separate additive material pass supplies self-lit cores and halos
without depth writes or shadow casting; solid depth and atmospheric attenuation
still obscure them. [Gun behavior](spec/damage-smoke.md#gun-dispersion-and-luminous-tracers).
Aircraft damage keeps six aircraft-local accumulators beside the existing hit
points. Gun segments intersect fitted nose, cockpit, core, wing and tail volumes;
surface objects remain on their ordinary object damage path. `damage_art` packs
intact and damaged PICs losslessly into one runtime atlas per identity. It adds
persistent imported-texture marks at light regional damage, then selects a
reviewed A/C body only when its missing region matches the hit. Other regions
use fitted, mirrored face clipping. Damaged shapes bypass intact-model animation
address maps.

`combat::debris` computes both fitted A/B and C/D attachments from inert shape bounds and advances
pieces at 120 Hz with inherited velocity, gravity and tumble. First swept terrain
contact retires a piece and creates a short visual ground impact. The runtime
atlas also contains the matching fragment textures. Fragment state belongs to
combat simulation, so replay and rendering consume the same breakup lifecycle.

Quick Mission's `ai_wings` bridge mirrors live actor poses and damage, while
combat retains movement ownership of wrecks. Each AI projectile carries its
own weapon record; rendering resolves its shape by resource name, independent
of the player's station numbering. The simulation owns delayed warnings,
individual dispenser releases and scoped wing requests. The app realizes
those events in the existing projectile and effect services. See the
[AI integration contract](spec/ai.md#live-integration-and-authored-boundaries).

Wing commands use `AiMission::order_wing_report` for scoped per-recipient
outcomes. The player bridge resolves orders and applies B43 control effects;
AI requests use the same B46 receiver after all actors decide. `ai_wings/orders`
and `reports` keep delivery and advisory text separate from physical steering.
`audio::Mixer` owns a bounded serial radio queue, independent of simulation
execution. `tore-formats::radio` reads reviewed inert phrase records during
import; the existing archive and PCM readers load original recordings.
Radio chatter is observation only: `ai_wings/chatter` turns mission output
into events, combat's strike list attributes projectile damage, and
`radio_calls` words them and applies the listener rule before `comms` delivers
them. Each decision, said or held back, is also written to a bounded,
write-only journal (`comms::journal`) that the host drains once a tick
([communication journal](REPLAYS.md#communication-journal)).
[Radio chatter](spec/radio-chatter.md#implementation-in-tore),
[command behavior](spec/ai.md#live-wing-command-and-radio-integration),
[radio data](formats/radio.md), [controls](INPUT.md#player-wing-orders).

Routine formation transitions share previous-tick velocity intentions through
the immutable traffic snapshot. Each actor owns its staged route and yielding
position; no coordinator moves aircraft directly. Live random slot offsets are
smoothed in `Controller`, with vertical amplitude reduced to five feet. The
[transition specification](spec/ai.md#normal-formation-variation-and-transitions)
owns the fitted parameters and limits.

Smooth lens flare is a continuous optical-light composite over the completed
world, so the sky gradient is not quantized inside flare circles. Stepped mode
keeps indexed remapping. Water's solar glint tests geometric light visibility
before adding reflected sunlight; ordinary water shadow tint is a separate
operation. See [glare](spec/sun-glow.md#continuous-lens-flare-composition) and
[water reflection](spec/ocean.md#separate-sun-and-environment-reflection-trial).

## Airport scenes

Airport scenes are immutable imported data owned by `terrain::Terrain`. Their
static GPU geometry belongs to `scenery::Scenery`, which builds it from the same
placements (`terrain::Placements`) under a 32 MiB budget. It is batched by
placement and filtered each frame from combat-owned
target HP, so destroyed objects disappear consistently in main and mirror
views; a replay filters by its recorded destroyed objects instead. The airport
service derives availability from those combat targets and
owns player selection, clearance, landing progress, and typed replies.
Weather-only reconstruction preserves service and combat state. Theater changes
and flight restart rebuild both from the imported scene.

`tore-sim::ai::airfield` owns AI takeoff and landing sequences. The app resolves
STRIP anchors and home runways, then passes terrain and landable surfaces to
`AiMission::step_with_surface`. Aircraft motion remains driven by pilot inputs;
the renderer has no role in traffic gates or landing decisions.
[Behavior and fitted safety rules](spec/ai-airfield.md).
`airfield_radio` observes those states and player runway context without changing
flight. It coalesces status by actor and uses the shared `comms` channel, with
separate airport audio ownership for cancellation. Quick Mission resolves a
validated queue along the final taxiway legs before any actor is created.

The creator stores its accepted ground-start runway identity separately from the
editable draft. It constructs the existing airborne wing launch reference first,
then initializes the player's whole wing on the shared runway surface. Restart
reuses the accepted launch layout, airport, fuel and stores. Building height
inside a composite runway shape never supplies the support-plane elevation.
Terrain render triangles are split at airport footprint edges and recessed
below the fixed support plane, with perimeter walls. Source terrain and physics
queries are unchanged. Static solid and texture passes use ordered equal-depth
tests with no slope bias, and only the texture pass has any constant bias (one
depth ULP, to settle paint ties), so they cannot pull pavement in front of
aircraft. A per-shape vertical normalization
aligns the dominant horizontal paving layer with the placement's runway plane;
building height does not move that plane.

`runway_wind` classifies imported MTOW and decomposes wind relative to a supplied
heading. Hybrid aerodynamics consume full wind; wheel physics consumes the bounded
crosswind/tailwind difficulty fraction as a tire-grip adjustment;
HUD departure/ILS cues consume its unscaled assessment using the active runway
end. It leaves airborne wind, flight-adapter selection and clearance logic
independent. [Rules](spec/runway-wind.md).

Hybrid takeoff combines an airflow-dependent device-drag factor, imported flap
lift, and continuous low-speed lift allowance. Contact receives remaining wheel
load from world-vertical support forces, classifies touchdown before changing
velocity, then resolves post-tire movement or wheel release. This keeps parked
stability separate from aerodynamic airflow and avoids discarding small climbs.
[Takeoff/contact behavior](spec/takeoff-ground-contact.md).

The shared [HUD layout and startup rules](spec/hud-layout.md) keep projected
flight and targeting geometry separate from fixed readouts. NAV presentation
hides weapon-specific symbols while retaining the selected target cue. Player
startup applies gun/SAFE selection after loadout reset, with ground NAV chosen
by the application; explicit diagnostic overrides are resolved afterward.

Airport guidance receives the aircraft body-forward vector from live flight or
recorded launcher pose. It filters threshold candidates through the shared
90-degree forward cone and range/airport-altitude band before returning either
armed or active ILS data. Head-look is not an input, and replay needs no new
wire field. [Arming contract](spec/airports.md#ils-arming-envelope).

`flight_map.rs` draws the Shift-M map as an opaque flight overlay. Simulation
map observations combine the active sensor and visual returns, including surface
objects, without adding surface targets to air-to-air selection. The renderer
receives observed positions and identification flags. Right-side map buttons
filter only presentation. An explicit structural-resource allowlist hides
buildings by default, including unidentified returns, while preserving defenses
and other surface objects. Original MCICONS artwork
is optional for older caches. [Display rules](spec/flight-map.md).

The [target window](spec/target-window.md) builds read-only presentation data in
`tore-world::target_window`; its refresh clock, camera and picture contrast are
in `tore-app::target_preview`. It uses the same retained selection as the HUD,
existing aircraft activity, and an independent weather slot. Its asynchronous
camera results carry the requested target identity so a changed selection cannot
reuse another target's picture. No display state feeds combat decisions.

Quick Mission [Dummy aircraft](spec/dummy-aircraft.md) carry a separate launch
mode. The mission actor moves them at a fixed 400 knots instead of invoking its
combat controller or aerodynamic flight. They retain the existing world snapshot,
damage mirror and target identities alongside normal AI aircraft.

Target-camera readbacks preserve a scenery coverage mask in alpha for the 10%
background darkening, then restore opaque panel pixels. Camera-specific near
clipping improves magnified subject depth precision. Target preview requests use
an independent 24 Hz phase clock; the other camera panels retain their existing
refresh interval.

## Ownship systems state

`tore-sim::aircraft_systems` coordinates separate engine, fluids, fuel, controls,
structure and pilot components. Each owns its fault state and fixed-tick
progression. The coordinator couples oil pressure to engine temperature and
combines fatal outcomes; it does not own the components' timer arithmetic.
Regional structural effects supply one shared set of flight penalties for both
flight adapters, using the same regional fractions as the damage renderer.
The renderer currently hides all airframe marks and tears below 100% damage;
this gate never changes component state or aerodynamic penalties. The app transfers newly selected combat faults exactly once, resolves
hardpoint identities and forwards notifications to the existing sim log. Flight
applies power, controls and actuator limits, and consumes source tank fuel. The
Systems raster only reads this state. D is a report action and never applies a
hit. See [the behavior contract](spec/systems-damage.md).

## Wreck lifecycle

`tore-sim::wreck` owns fixed-tick aerodynamic wreck motion, captured per-engine
thrust and an independent explosion RNG. Ownship flight and combat targets both
use it after destruction; living AI decisions are untouched. The AI bridge only
copies live propulsion metadata for later use by the wreck. Airburst events
trigger existing audio/effects and hide the whole airframe and detached pieces.
[Behavior contract](spec/destroyed-aircraft.md).

## Pilot escape ownership

`tore-sim::ejection` owns seat/chute motion, survival and the fitted recovery
assessment. Player commands are recorded in the existing pilot tape; AI decides
before weapon releases. Combat continues to own AI wreck motion, while the
mission retains the detached pilot. The app imports original indexed art into
a separate texture batch and schedules voice/effect transitions. See the
[ejection specification](spec/ejection.md) and [source notes](formats/ejection.md).

## Mission recordings

`crates/tore-replay` is dependency free and knows nothing of the simulation
or the renderer: the recording model, the chunked writer, the bounded reader
and the exports (debug log, summary, anomaly flags, Tacview, comparison).
`tore-app/src/replay/` is the only place the app's types meet it.

The capture boundary is the per-tick `RenderSnapshot` (`snapshot.rs` in `tore-world`). Each tick, right after
the AI step, `replay/recorder.rs` reads the snapshot live flight draws plus
flight data the snapshot lacks, and diffs both against the previous tick to
find launches, hits, crashes, departures and AI activity changes.
`replay/convert.rs` turns a snapshot into frame pieces and a decoded frame
back into a snapshot; the draw rules that hold for a whole flight (loaded
models, which ids draw with them) travel in the header. Everything the
recorder reads was already computed by the tick. The few outputs it needed
are write-only and bounded, drained by the host and never read by flight: the
combat ledger's list of shot outcomes, combat's notes of released chaff and
flares and of the player's decoy rolls, the cockpit message lines in
`FlightUi`, the player commands in `Combat`, the AI message journal
(`AiWings::take_ai_journal`, handed to the recorder in `Tick::journal`) and
the communication journal (`Recorder::drain_comms`). Frames go to a writer
thread through a queue two seconds deep; a full queue drops the frame and the
next reports a gap, so the flight never waits for the disk. Probes with
recording on and off print byte-identical output.

A recording is made for one seat (`Recorder::for_seat`, built in B5): the plane
that seat flies is the recording's player, single player's default being seat 0
flying plane 0. The recorder reads that plane's flight, controls and ownship
where it read "the player, id 0", and records every other aircraft, human-flown
planes included, the way it records an AI aircraft (`Tick::others` gives it
their cockpits). A comms entry whose `heard_by` names only other seats is left
out of the recording, and `heard_by` itself is not written. The header carries
`draw.player` when the plane is not plane 0, and `convert::snapshot` reads it.
The viewer follows `draw.player` (slice F2-O2). See
[REPLAYS.md](REPLAYS.md#whose-flight-it-is).

The reasons live beside the capture: `replay/recorder/why.rs` reads the AI's
controller and actor records, the flight model's `FlightTrace` and the
bridge's decoy rolls, emits reason events on each change, and samples the
display trees at their rates; `replay/recorder/journal.rs` maps the two
journals to `comms.*`, `ai.defense` and `audio.music` events;
`replay/trees.rs` builds the trees as pure functions of those records, so
a live debug panel can build the same tree from the current tick.

`replay/library.rs` owns the `replays/` folder: names, `replays-v1.conf`
auto-delete settings, listing from each file's header, seek index and footer
(`Recording::peek`), and a cleanup that deletes only proven, unkept, inactive
recordings. `replay::identity::of` captures the resolved terrain for the
header and `replay::identity::terrain` rebuilds it, without environment
variables, through `Terrain::for_recorded`.
`replay/screen.rs` is the Replays screen, a main-menu overlay built from the
Controls screen's drawing helpers that reads a recording's details and
writes its exports on background threads the menu's redraw polls, so the
menu never waits on a file.
`replay/cli.rs` holds the `--recording-*` commands and the tick-by-tick
render check. See [mission replays](REPLAYS.md).

The mission replay viewer is its own screen, `Screen::Replay`, run by
`replay/viewer.rs` and wired into the app by `replay/host.rs`, which takes the
screen's window events before `main`'s own handling and hands back what the
app still owns: resizing, focus, Alt-Enter and quitting. The viewer owns a
`Terrain` and `Scenery` built from the recording's identity and its own
airframes, so the Quick Mission screen's world is untouched. Entering the
screen points the renderer at them (`set_scenery`, then `prepare_aircraft` for the recorded
player, since a world rebuild discards the aircraft); leaving restores the
game's world and ownship the same way. Each frame rebuilds the moment under
the playhead from the recording (`replay/playback.rs`) and makes the same
renderer calls as live flight, with the cockpit and mirrors switched off every
frame and a blank flight canvas carrying only the viewer's interface. Nothing
it draws feeds back into the simulation; see [replays](REPLAYS.md#viewer).
Its Esc menu (`replay/pause.rs`) is flight's paused menu widget
(`pause_menu.rs`, which `flight_ui.rs` embeds) over a tree built from the
imported one; the Graphics and Sound screens it opens stay the app's, drawn
into a layer the viewer puts over its frame, with their input left to
`main`'s handlers while they are open.
`replay/sound.rs` turns the stretch of recording each frame played at 1x
forwards into plain-data cues for the same audio calls live flight makes,
with the viewer's camera as the listener, and cancels them on a seek; see
[replay sound](REPLAYS.md#sound). The names it acts on (tone names, routes,
the two tower triggers, and `vocab::heard` for which entry of a line was
heard) live in `tore_replay::vocab`, which the recorder writes with.

The [debug panels](REPLAYS.md#debug-panels) are one code path for both hosts.
`replay/panels.rs` draws any display tree and the Comms panel in a 640x480
layer from a `Data` source: the replay's reads the recording at the playhead
through a per-chunk cache of decoded trees, live flight's (`replay/live.rs`)
keeps the latest of each tree and the comms and audio entries the recorder
writes (`Recorder::take_trees`, `Recorder::take_comms`), so a live panel
shows exactly what the recording holds. `replay/context_menu.rs` holds the
right-click menu, picking through the drawn camera's projection, and the
click-or-drag rule. The layer is composited centred on the view, only where a
panel or the menu drew (`FlightCanvas::centered_rects`). In flight the panels
only read: the menu's camera changes go through the ordinary view commands.

## Promo reel capture

`reel.rs` and the replay viewer's `director` module render promo footage. They read complete recordings into the same presentation helpers and `SimRenderer`, using a surface-free wgpu device and GPU readback. They never advance aircraft or AI state. On the multiplayer branch they take the viewer's `Terrain` (from `tore-world`) and `Scenery` as the replay viewer does: the renderer is built from the scenery, and each frame draws with both. Python expands the checked shot timeline and sends exact recorded ticks and camera parameters; a second cockpit pass can read back the HUD symbols alone, and the offline mixer can keep speech on its own stem. See the [production recipe](../tools/reel/README.md).

## Mission core and seats

Design for stages A and B of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written 2026-09-28. **Stages A and B are built, and stage C rebuilt them on main
with the bug bash** ([how stage C landed](#how-stage-c-landed)). The section is rewritten as
the stages land. John approved the design on 2026-09-28 with the decisions
credited to him below; every other choice is an agent decision. His decisions
are also in the [multiplayer guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions).

In short:

- One type, `World`, owns the whole mission and advances it one 120 Hz tick at a
  time, with no window, GPU or audio. Single player, a player-hosted game and a
  dedicated server all drive the same `World`.
- Inside `World::step` the simulation runs in today's order. What the tick did
  for the screen, the speakers, the controllers and the replay recorder happens
  after the step, in the same order, from what the step reports.
- Every aircraft gets a pilot: the AI or a human seat. A human sends one
  tick-stamped input per tick. An aircraft can pass between the AI and a human in
  flight and keep its pose, fuel, stores and damage.
- Single player keeps its results tick for tick, apart from the changes John
  approved, listed under [single-player guarantee](#single-player-guarantee).

### Where the code stands

Stages A1 and A2 are built. The mission core is the `tore-world` crate
(`crates/tore-world`), which depends on `tore-sim`, `tore-formats` and
`tore-input` and on nothing that draws, opens a window or plays sound. `World`
(`crates/tore-world/src/world.rs`) holds the mission state that `App` used to
keep in separate fields and steps it in `World::step`. The redraw loop builds
each tick's input, calls the step and hands the output to a `TickPresenter` in
`main.rs`, which plays the cues in the loop's old order. `World::restart`
rebuilds a flight from its `Setup`. The AI probe runs the same tick, so
headless runs cover the live loop, and a fingerprint test
(`crates/tore-world/src/world/tick_tests.rs`) pins its order. The terrain is
split: `Terrain` (`terrain.rs`, in `tore-world`) holds what the simulation
queries and `Scenery` (`scenery.rs`, in the app) what the renderer draws, and
`App` holds a `Scenery` beside `World`. Combat and the aircraft are split as
well: `AircraftType` apart from `Airframe`, `Combat` apart from its art,
models, readouts and tape file (`CombatView` in the app's `combat_view.rs`
holds the app's half), and the render snapshot's data (`snapshot.rs`) apart
from its vertex building.

`tore-world` holds these modules, and the app re-exports each at its crate root
(`pub(crate) use tore_world::{...}` in `main.rs`) so app code keeps its
`crate::combat` style paths:

| Module | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `world` | `World`, `Setup`, `TickInput`, `TickOutput` and `step`; `world/tick_tests.rs` is the fingerprint |
| `terrain` | `Terrain`, its `Overrides` and the shared `Placements` loader |
| `combat`, `combat_tape` | `Combat`; the tape's command names and the `Entry` record |
| `aircraft_type` | `AircraftType`, the simulation's view of one aircraft |
| `snapshot` | The tick's picture as data (`RenderSnapshot`, poses, `interpolate`) |
| `ai_wings` | `AiWings`, its orders, reports, chatter and engagement |
| `comms`, `radio_calls`, `crew_voice`, `airfield_radio` | The radio channel and every call generator |
| `situation` | The situation music's selector; the mission result check it reads is `ai_wings::outcome` |
| `mission_layout`, `target_window` | The Quick Mission layout and the target window's data |
| `test_support` | Synthetic fixtures for tests here and, through the `test-support` feature, in the app |

The app keeps what draws, listens or writes: `camera.rs` (the free camera, whose
start point is `Terrain::free_flight_start`), `combat_smoke.rs` (the
`--combat-smoke` check, which reads `TORE_COMBAT_EVIDENCE`), `tape_file.rs` (the
combat tape's writer and reader), `ai_roster_probe.rs` (the
`--ai-roster-probe-ticks` check, which prints) and the presentation half of
each split module. `tore-world` has its own `WorldResult` alias for boxed-error
results, uses `tore_sim::flight` and `tore_sim::attitude` directly, and has no
`log`, `tore-replay`, `unsafe` or environment variable read outside test code.

Stage B's first slice, B0, is built. `seats.rs` holds the planes, pilots and
seats below: `World::roster` lists every plane with its pilot and every seat,
and single player is seat 0 flying plane 0. What a human-flown plane keeps
outside combat (its flight, the flight at the start of the tick, turbulence,
the airport service, NAV mode and the clocks of its world-edge and OVERSPEED
messages) is a `Cockpit`, one per human-flown plane in
`World::cockpits`; the app presents `cockpits[0]`. `World::step` takes one
`SeatInput` from every seat that flies a plane, for the tick `World::tick`
names, and applies each seat's commands to its own plane. The flight step,
building contact, turbulence, the world edge and OVERSPEED rules and the
airport service run for every cockpit in
plane order, the first four through the
[shared plane step](#one-step-for-a-humans-plane). Combat keeps one ownship per human-flown plane (B1), and the AI
is handed every human-flown plane that has one (B3, see [the AI with several
humans](#the-ai-with-several-humans)). The radio is per seat (slice B4, below): each seat has its own
delivery queue, busy hold and radio silence, and each call is generated once.
B2 is built as well: everything a player does between ticks is a `SeatCommand`
in that seat's input, applied by `world/commands.rs` at the start of the tick
(see [seat input](#seat-input)). B3, the AI with several humans, is built. Every
AI aircraft is an `AiActor` in `tore-sim::ai` plus a `live::Target` row,
mirrored into each other once per tick. The plan's [code findings](multiplayer-plan.md#where-the-code-stands)
describe the code before stage A.

### Stage A: one mission core

#### What `World` owns

| `World` owns | The app keeps |
| --- | --- |
| The player's flight state, and its state at the start of the tick | The frame clock, pause and time compression (`flight::Clock`, `FlightUi`) |
| Combat: weapons, projectiles, targets, damage, effects, smoke, debris and the ledger | Cameras, views, look, zoom and head tracking |
| The AI wings (`AiWings` and its `AiMission`) | The HUD, instruments, flight menu and on-screen messages |
| The terrain and the weather clock (`Environment`) | Per-camera weather presentation, palettes and the render origin |
| The airport service and navigation mode | Audio: radio playback, music, RWR tones and spatial sound |
| Turbulence and its random numbers | Blackout and redout, and wing vapor, which only the renderer reads |
| Radio call generation: the tower, the crew voice, weapon, hit and wing calls, and the radio channel | Input devices, rumble and the input tape |
| The settings in force: cheats, AI mission preset, enemy skill and flight model | The replay recorder and library, and the debug panels |

Today's terrain type `terrain::World` was renamed `Terrain` first, in a commit of
its own. `Theater` would read better but already names the parsed T2 grid in
`tore-formats`. `Terrain` has been split in two, ahead of the crate move:

- `Terrain` (`terrain.rs`, `World` owns it) is what the simulation queries: the
  T2 grid, the map layout and weather choice, the airport scene and its runway
  anchors, the weather clock, and `height`, `surface`, `over_water`,
  `turbulence_reduced_surface`, `solid_contact`, `wind`, `air_data` and
  `runway_view`. It holds no art, palette or render origin, reads no
  environment variable and uses no `log`, `tore_replay` or presentation module.
  The weather time, wind and cloud altitude that `TORE_WEATHER_TIME`,
  `TORE_WIND` and `TORE_CLOUD_ALTITUDE` set arrive as an explicit `Overrides`
  that the app reads (`scenery::launch_overrides`); a recording's identity
  replaces them (`Terrain::for_recorded`). The camera type `Camera` is
  presentation geometry the simulation never reads, so it lives in the app
  (`camera.rs`); the point a free flight and the free camera start from is
  `Terrain::free_flight_start`, which both use.
- `Scenery` (`scenery.rs`, `App` owns it) is what the renderer draws: the land,
  sky and deck textures, the terrain mesh, the static airport geometry, ocean
  motion, the weather presentations for the main view and the four auxiliary
  camera slots, the resolved palette, fog and haze, and the render origin. It
  builds from the resources and the finished `Terrain`, and code that needs the
  weather or the airport scene takes `&Terrain` beside `&Scenery`. It is
  rebuilt wherever the terrain is (theater or weather change), its camera
  weather restarts where a flight starts (`Scenery::reset_presentations`, next
  to `World::restart`), and the replay viewer owns its own pair. The scenery
  and the terrain's airport scene share one loader (`terrain::Placements`), so
  the object volumes and the drawn shapes always agree.

#### One tick

`World::step` runs these in order. It is today's order with the presentation
taken out:

1. **Settings and commands.** The mission's commands (the cheats) are applied,
   then each seat's scope controls and commands, in seat order and in the order
   given: weapon selection, designation, arming, chaff and flares, the trigger,
   navigation-page and airport commands, radio silence and wing orders.
2. The player's flight state at the start of the tick is kept as `previous_flight`.
3. **Player flight.** The flight model steps with the tick's pilot input over
   the runway and terrain surface, with wind.
4. **Building contact**: a crash, or a rebound under the No Crashes cheat.
5. A fault in the restricted native research adapter stops the tick here and is
   reported. Nothing else in the tick runs, as today.
6. **Weather clock**: one environment step.
7. **Turbulence** acts on the player. Then the world edge (a turn-back
   warning from 100 nm beyond the map, the loss at 105 nm) and the OVERSPEED
   message are checked.
8. **Combat.** The trigger level is set, then combat steps: sensors, the player's
   weapons, projectiles, hits, damage, wrecks and contrails.
9. **Airport service.** It learns which runway objects were destroyed, then
   steps. The AI wings learn whether the player is landing.
10. **Events.** Every human-flown plane's system messages and combat's events
    are applied: jolts, destruction and weapon release sounds.
11. **AI.** Hit reports, then every AI actor, then crash sites and ejections.
12. **The tick's picture**: the render snapshot, with this tick's shot outcomes
    and AI journal.
13. **Radio.** The tower, the crew voice and the weapon, hit and wing calls are
    generated, and the calls due now are delivered.
14. Sound emissions are collected.

After the step the app presents the tick in the order the loop used to: HUD
messages, rumble, tower audio, the view change when the pilot dies, per-camera
weather, the view rig, wing vapor, blackout and redout, control-surface and
ejection sounds, the replay recorder's calls, radio playback, situation music,
RWR tones and spatial sound. The recorder's mid-tick call reads the finished
tick: the steps after the picture only generate radio calls and drain queues it
never reads, so what it records is unchanged.

*Agent decision:* because presentation now runs after the whole tick, a few
presentation steps read the end of the tick instead of its middle: per-camera
weather, the view rig's tracking of the player's last missile, wing vapor,
blackout and redout, and control-surface sounds. Before, they saw other
aircraft before those had moved in this tick, and the player before combat's
jolts. No simulation value, recording or fingerprint changes. In some views a
cloud tint, a vapor trail or the end of a blackout can differ by one tick
(1/120 s).

#### Tick input and output

Each tick's input is one `SeatInput` per seat (built in B0 and completed in B2)
and, for the mission, a list of `MissionCommand`s. A seat's input holds the
pilot input (`PilotInput`: stick, throttle and pilot commands such as gear,
flaps, radar power and eject), the trigger level, the scope controls and the
commands given since the last tick. Every command a player gives, from weapon
selection to wing orders, travels this way; see [seat input](#seat-input).

`TickOutput` holds, in tick order: combat's events; an ordered list of cues (HUD
lines, rumble, tower audio cues, weapon page turns, order calls, ejection
notices, delivered radio calls, and the points where the flight, combat and the
picture were done); how many of those cues the command phase made
(`commanded`); what became of each wing order (`orders`); every seat's weapon
release sounds (`releases`); shot outcomes; the AI journal; sound emissions; and
the native fault, if the tick stopped early. Every output queue inside `World`
is drained into it each tick, whether or not anyone reads it, so the state
between ticks never depends on its consumers. The radio's journal and the
player's command notes still go to the replay recorder directly, as they did
before.

**Every seat-specific output names its seat** (slice B7a, built). A host that
serves several seats reads each seat's own output from the one list, and a
presenter shows only the cues addressed to its seat, in the order they came:

| Output | Seat it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `Cue::Message { seat, text }` | A command's reply, the tower, "Landing complete" and the other cockpit lines belong to the seat whose plane they are about. Every human-flown plane's systems messages (`flight.systems.messages`) are drained every tick into its own seat, in cockpit order. |
| `Cue::Feedback { seat, event }` | Turbulence to the seat whose plane it shakes. Gun, missile, damage and crash feedback to the seat that flies the plane the combat event names. |
| `Cue::Tower { seat, stem }` | The seat whose tower request or clearance it is. |
| `Cue::WeaponCycled { seat }`, `Cue::OrderVoice { seat, stems }` | The seat that pressed the weapon page button or gave the order. |
| `Cue::Radio { seat, call }` | The seat that hears the call (built in B4). |
| `TickOutput::releases`, each a `Release { seat, sound, station }` | The seat whose plane fired; `station` indexes that plane's stores. |
| `OrderReply { seat, .. }` in `TickOutput::orders` | The seat that gave the order. |
| An aircraft's airburst | Every seat reads it: "Your aircraft exploded" for the seat that flew the aircraft, "Destroyed aircraft exploded" for every other. "Your aircraft exploded on impact" is for the seat that flew the aircraft only. |
| The AI wings' HUD line (`AiWings::take_message`) | Each seat whose plane flies in Friendly Wing 1, single player's wing. |
| `Cue::Flown`, `CombatStepped`, `Picture`, `WingEjection` | The mission: every presenter reads them. |

*Agent decision (B7a):* the AI wings' line carries two things in one queue: the
formation reports of Friendly Wing 1's members, and the activity line ("Enemy
2-1: Attacking") for any AI aircraft. Its one natural audience is the wing the
reports describe, so it goes to the seats flying in Friendly Wing 1, in cockpit
order. Single player flies the lead of that wing, so its output is unchanged. A
seat in another wing, or on the enemy side, sees none of it. Splitting the queue
by wing, so that other wings' seats hear their own activity, is left to the AI
wings' owner. A seat that has no ownship in combat gets no feedback or release
sound, since it fired nothing.

The app's `TickPresenter` and the AI probe present only `SEAT`'s cues, releases
and order replies (the recorder's release list is `seat_releases` in `main.rs`);
the markers and `WingEjection` are read whatever the seat.

#### Drivers

- **Single player:** the render loop keeps its frame clock, pause and time
  compression, builds each tick's input from the input devices and the
  instruments, calls `step` once per tick and presents the output.
- **AI probe** (`--ai-probe-ticks`, `--probe-matrix`): runs `World::step`. It
  gained weather, turbulence, building contact, the airport service, crew voice,
  event handling without the attack script and the runway surface with wind; its
  output and recordings changed once for this, in their own commit, the one
  planned change of probe output. The scripted pilot, the attack script, orders
  and threat fixtures act before each step, and the probe presents what it needs
  from the tick's output in the live order.
- **Full-tick fingerprint:** `crates/tore-world/src/world/tick_tests.rs` builds a
  `World` from synthetic fixtures (a low-flying player, two friendly and two
  enemy AI aircraft, two drones, a small airport), steps it 1,200 ticks with
  scripted input and folds the player's flight, combat's projectiles and
  targets, every AI actor, the weather clock and the whole `TickOutput` into
  one fingerprint each tick. It pins the tick order: a step that is swapped,
  dropped or repeated changes the value. It follows the conventions of the
  existing goldens (`tore-sim`'s `golden_tests.rs`): two runs in one process
  must match on every platform, and the recorded value is compared only on
  macOS on Apple silicon. The value is not recorded yet, because it can only be
  generated there: until it is set, that platform's run fails with the value in
  its message, and the constant `RECORDED` is then filled in. A deliberate
  behaviour change updates it in the same commit.
  `TORE_GOLDEN_VERBOSE=1` prints the fingerprint every 120 ticks to find where
  a change starts.
- **Unchanged:** `--headless-flight` and `--replay-input` stay the isolated
  flight-model probe, and the component probes (`--flight-probe-ticks`,
  `--countermeasure-preview`, `--combat-probe-ticks`, `--replay-combat`,
  `--combat-smoke`, `--ai-roster-probe-ticks`) keep testing one component each.
- **Later:** the dedicated server (stage D) and the player-hosted game's thread
  (stage E) drive the same `step` from a fixed 120 Hz clock that never pauses.

#### Rules for mission state

These make exact checkpoints (stage H) possible. They apply to everything in
`tore-world` and to all new mission state from stage B on:

- No file handles, sockets, threads, locks, `Rc`/`RefCell` or stored closures.
  The combat tape, the formation trace and the replay recorder are writers
  outside `World`, fed from its input and output.
- Imported data that never changes (terrain, aircraft, weapon and radio records)
  is shared by reference and named by content. Mutable state holds ids, not
  copies.
- One authoritative tick counter, `World::tick`. The component counters that
  exist today stay and are checked against it.
- No wall clock, no hash-map iteration and no unseeded random numbers. Every
  random stream has a fixed seed from the mission and, for an aircraft, its slot.
- No environment variables read inside `World`. The weather time, wind, cloud
  altitude and turbulence overrides are resolved into the mission setup before
  `World::new`, so every peer runs one configuration. One known exception: the
  flight model's weight-scaled stall speed can be switched off for the whole
  process with `--retail-stall-speeds` or `TORE_RETAIL_STALL_SPEEDS=1`
  (`tore_sim::flight::retail_stall_speeds`). It is a developer option, never a
  mission setting, and a networked game must not rely on it.
- No `log` or `tore-replay` in `tore-world`: warnings go into the tick output,
  and conversions to replay types live in the app.
- Combat's one second of hit volumes and the rewinds of the rounds in flight
  ([lag compensation](#hits-and-lag-compensation)) are mission state like the
  rounds themselves: a checkpoint carries them.

#### How stage A lands

A1, inside `tore-app`, done. Each commit was compared with the single-player
baselines byte for byte:

1. Rename `terrain::World` to `terrain::Terrain`.
2. Add `World` (`crates/tore-world/src/world.rs`) and move the mission fields of
   `App` into it. The tick body still runs in the redraw handler.
3. Move the tick body into `World::step`, with presentation after it.
4. Move the simulation half of a flight's start (`FreeFlight`, which is also
   restart) into `World::restart`, from a `Setup` that the creator fills when
   the player presses Fly, so a restart no longer reads the creator's UI state.
   A `World::new` that builds a mission with no app at all followed the A2
   splits, since combat was still built from the aircraft's render model; it is
   stage D's slice D3b (see [a mission with no window](#a-mission-with-no-window)).
5. Switch the AI probe to `World::step` (re-recorded output).
6. Add the full-tick fingerprint.

A2 first split, inside `tore-app`, what mixes simulation with presentation, then
moved the simulation set into `tore-world`. Both are done. The splits:

- `Airframe`: the aircraft type the simulation needs apart from the render
  model. Done: `AircraftType` (`aircraft_type.rs`) holds the profile, flight
  model, sensors and the engine outlet points that contrails and afterburner
  lights use, and `start` for the player's flight. `AircraftType::load` reads
  the simulation half from the resources (D3b); `Airframe::load` calls it and
  adds what only the drawn model gives, the engine outlets. `Airframe` (`aircraft.rs`)
  holds an `Arc<AircraftType>` beside the art, cockpit, HUD, animation rig and
  damage art, and dereferences to it. `World::restart`, `Combat::new`,
  `Combat::with_loadout` and the combat smoke harness take `&AircraftType`.
  The wing vapor attachments (`streamer_points`) stay on `Airframe`, since only
  the renderer reads them.
- `Combat`: its art, readouts and target cameras move out, and its render
  history splits from the interpolation. Done: `Combat` holds no art
  and no drawn model. It keeps an `Arc<AircraftType>` for every other aircraft
  type the mission loads (`dummy_types`), and the app keeps the matching
  `Airframe`s and the effect, smoke, weapon and ejection art (`CombatArt`) in
  a `CombatView` (`combat_view.rs`) beside the world, rebuilt wherever combat
  is. `combat_view.rs` also holds what reads `&Combat` for the screen: vertex
  building (`dummy_geometry`, `vertices`), the afterburner lights, the target
  window's cameras, `readout`, `status` and `equipment_damage_report`.
  `mission_aircraft` and `mission_dummies` take a loader that hands combat each
  type once; `CombatView::mission_aircraft` and `mission_dummies` load the
  drawn model with it. `render_snapshot.rs` is split: the tick's picture as
  data (`RenderSnapshot`, the pose types, the devices, `interpolate`, `blend`,
  `pose_state`) is `snapshot.rs`, and the vertex building stays in
  `render_snapshot.rs`. `Combat` keeps the last two snapshots, since an
  aircraft whose AI stopped flying holds the devices last drawn for it, and
  the frame's tick fraction and the blend at it are `CombatView`'s
  (`present`, `presented`, `pose`, `target_camera`); `flight_views::Scene::new`
  takes the view when it should place targets at the frame's fraction. A
  restart of the render history (`Combat::render_restarts`) puts the fraction
  back to 1 until the next frame sets one, as before. `Contact`,
  `CombatGeometry` and `Afterburner` stay in their renderer files: only the
  drawing reads them once combat's vertex building has left, so nothing on the
  simulation side needs them moved.
- `Terrain`: the simulation half apart from the scenery, as above. Done.
- Quick Mission setup apart from the creator's UI: `mission_layout.rs` holds
  the mission layout, ground layout, runway poses and map bounds, and
  `quick_mission.rs` keeps the creator's screen (done in this stage); the debrief evaluator (`capture`, `report`) apart from its
  pages (done in D7a: the evaluator lives in `tore_world::debrief` so a dedicated server can build each seat's report, and the app's `debrief.rs` keeps the screen and re-exports it); the target window's data apart from its refresh clock (`target_window.rs`
  keeps the data, `target_preview.rs` the clock and camera; done in this stage). The temporary re-exports these two splits left in `quick_mission.rs` and `target_window.rs` are gone: combat, its view and `world.rs` name `mission_layout` and `target_preview` directly.
- File writers and environment-variable reads leave simulation code, and `log`
  calls become output. The formation trace is done: `AiWings` collects its rows
  in a bounded list, and `formation_trace.rs` in the app reads
  `TORE_FORMATION_TRACE` and writes the file.
  The combat tape is done too: `Combat` holds no file. While a tape is being
  recorded it collects each record (the action name and the `Launcher`, as
  `combat_tape::Entry`) in a write-only list (`start_tape`, `record_tape`,
  `take_tape`). The app owns the `tape_file::Recorder`, writes the list after
  every tick (`World::step` puts its airport records in the same list) and
  again when the tape ends. The tape's bytes are the same as before. The
  `TORE_COMBAT_EVIDENCE` variable stays in the `--combat-smoke` harness, which
  is a command-line check and not mission state.

Then `git mv` moved the simulation set into `crates/tore-world`, with a
`[profile.dev.package.tore-world] opt-level = 2` entry like `tore-sim`'s, and
`tore-app` depends on it. It went in four commits. First, `Camera` left
`terrain.rs` for the app's `camera.rs`, and the free-flight start point became
`Terrain::free_flight_start`, which both the camera and `AircraftType::start`
call. Second, the `--combat-smoke` check left `combat.rs` for the app's
`combat_smoke.rs`. Third, the combat tape's writer and reader left
`combat_tape.rs` for the app's `tape_file.rs`, leaving the names and `Entry`
with combat. Fourth, the crate: the modules listed under
[where the code stands](#where-the-code-stands), plus `test_support` and
`combat::fixtures`, which hold the synthetic terrain, aircraft profile, combat
scene and AI wing rows that tests in both crates use (the app enables
`test-support` through its `dev-dependencies`; the tests that only the app uses
stayed in it). `cargo tree -p tore-world` shows no wgpu, winit, cpal or
pollster. The full-tick fingerprint, every behaviour item of the baseline
harness, every capture that does not depend on frame timing and the live
recordings' shared checksums, states and events matched the commit before the
move.

**Verification.** A local harness (`.local/mp-baseline/`, never committed)
records golden fingerprints, headless flights, AI probes with their mission
recordings, input and combat tapes and a long probe's run time, and compares
them byte for byte after every commit. Because no headless path runs the live
loop today, commit 3 is checked by review against the old loop, line by line,
and by a live run on a display. From commit 5 on, the AI probe runs the same
tick, so every later change is covered.

### Stage B: seats

#### Aircraft, pilots and seats

```rust
pub struct PlaneId(pub u32);    // one aircraft of the mission, for the whole mission
pub struct SeatId(pub u8);      // one per human; single player is seat 0

pub struct Plane {              // World's roster, in id order
    pub id: PlaneId,
    pub slot: Slot,             // side, wing and member, fixed at setup
    pub pilot: Pilot,
}
pub enum Pilot {
    Ai,                         // the AI actor with this id flies it
    Human(SeatId),
}
pub struct Seat {
    pub id: SeatId,
    pub plane: Option<PlaneId>, // None: waiting or observing
    pub crew: Option<Crew>,     // the radio's name for a second seat
    // later: its radio queue, crew voice, tower conversation and wing recipient
}
pub struct SeatInput {
    pub seat: SeatId,
    pub tick: u64,              // the tick it applies to: World::tick
    pub pilot: PilotInput,
    pub trigger: bool,
    pub commands: Vec<SeatCommand>, // applied in order at the start of the tick
}
```

These live in `crates/tore-world/src/seats.rs` (built in B0), with `Roster`, which
holds the planes and seats. *Agent decision:* the design first called a plane's
id `AircraftId`, but that name already means an aircraft type
(`tore_formats::aircraft::AircraftId`, used about 600 times), so a mission's
aircraft are planes. The scope controls and every between-tick command joined
`SeatInput` in B2, below.

`World::step(&[SeatInput])` takes one input per seat that flies a plane, and
refuses a missing, duplicate or wrong-tick input. Settings changes
(cheats in single player, the King's settings in multiplayer) are a separate
mission command, applied at the start of the tick before any seat.

**Where an aircraft's state lives.** An AI-flown aircraft keeps its state where
it lives today: the AI actor (flight state, stores, dispensers, sensors,
awareness) and its combat target row (hit points, hit sections, fault counts,
wreck). A human-flown aircraft has a `Cockpit` in `World` (flight state, its state
at the start of the tick, turbulence, the airport service and NAV mode) and an
ownship in combat (below). The flight state is the same type for both, `flight::State`.
Stores, damage and countermeasures convert exactly at a handoff, because the AI
and the cockpit both build them from the same `live::Configuration`.

*Agent proposal, approved by John on 2026-09-28:* this is a registry plus exact
conversion, not one struct
holding every aircraft. One struct would mean rewriting the AI mission, about
6,000 lines, to fly aircraft it does not own, and replacing single player's
damage rules. The registry gives the same guarantees (one id per aircraft, one
pilot at a time, nothing lost at a handoff) at much lower risk.

**Ids.** Aircraft keep today's numbers: the lead of Friendly Wing 1 is 0, the
other aircraft are numbered from 1 in the Quick Mission's roster order, and
ground objects stay at `0x4000_0000` upward. No code may assume that id 0 is a
human, since in multiplayer an AI may fly it: `PLAYER_OWNER` is gone (B1) and `PLAYER_ID` goes,
and code asks the aircraft's pilot instead. In single player, seat 0 flies
aircraft 0, exactly as today.

#### Seat input

*B2 is built (combat commands, scope and settings, wing orders, and the
pause and recording rules below).* The render loop builds seat 0's input from today's sources: the
pilot input, the trigger (Space and the bound fire control), the scope controls
and the commands given since the last tick. The app keeps them in one
queue in the order given (`App::seat_commands`); the first tick of the next
frame takes the whole queue, and `World::step` applies each command at the
start of the tick to the plane the seat flies. That is when they take effect
today, because window events always arrive between frames.

`SeatCommand` (`seats.rs`) lists them. Each is applied in
`world/commands.rs`, in the order given, by the cockpit of the seat's plane:

| Command | What the step does |
| --- | --- |
| `CycleWeapon` | The weapon selection steps and NAV mode follows the arming; the weapon page turns to it (`Cue::WeaponCycled { seat }`). |
| `Airport` | A NAV mode switch or a tower request, as in B0. |
| `Combat(command)` | Combat takes the command as it is: designation (next, previous, visual, by identity from a scope click) and the seeker mode or the designation release from the weapon display. |
| `Manual(command)` | A key, button or menu command: arming, seeker mode, clearing the designation, jettison and the range and development commands. It lets go of the trigger, gives combat the command, and puts the payload weight right. Outside `--live-fire` only arming, seeker and designation work, and the pilot gets "Manual range command requires --live-fire". |
| `RangeReset` | A new target on the range; "Target reset is available only with --live-fire" otherwise. |
| `ReleaseChaff`, `ReleaseFlare` | One cartridge or flare, with the retail messages ("Chaff launched, 11 left", "Out of flares"). Refused when the aircraft is destroyed, the pilot has ejected or it has no hit points. |
| `RadioSilence` | Toggles radio silence and tells the pilot ("Radio silence", "Radio traffic OK"). |
| `BattleNet` | Alt+N: toggles the seat's monitoring of the side's battle net and tells the pilot ("Monitoring battle net", "Battle net off"). Slice G8. |
| `WingRecipient` | Chooses the wingman the seat's orders address, or the whole wing. It is state of the seat (`Seat::wing_recipient`). |
| `WingOrder`, `WingFormationCycle` | An Alt-key order goes to the AI wings with the seat's recipient and its designated target. The formation cycle reads the wing's next formation first. The pilot's own order call comes back as `Cue::OrderVoice`, the wing's report and any refusal as `Cue::Message`, each naming the seat, and `TickOutput::orders` lists what became of each order, with its seat. |
| `ReleaseTrigger` | `Combat::cancel`, which a menu opening, a pause, a modifier key or losing focus does. |
| `TriggerKey` | The Space key going down or up, with the app's "blocked" flag (paused, out of focus or a modifier held). |

`SeatInput::sensors` carries the seat's scope controls (channel, display range
and contact history). The step sets them on the seat's flight before that
seat's commands, every tick; the app used to copy them into the flight once a
frame. The scope's labels follow the controls as they stand now, not the
flight's copy, so they never lag a switch that was just pressed.

Settings are not a seat's: `World::step_with` takes `MissionCommand`s, applied
at the start of the tick before any seat's commands. `Settings` holds the
cheats (which include the enemy skill and guns only switches the AI reads), and
the step puts them on every human-flown plane, combat and the AI wings. The
app sends them on a flight's first tick and whenever the flight menu changes
them; it used to copy them every frame. The friendly list that the designation
keys skip is set when a flight starts (`World::restart`), since it never
changes in flight.

The messages the commands give the pilot come back as `Cue::Message` in the
tick's output. `TickOutput::commanded` says how many of the first cues the
command phase made, so the app can act between the commands and the rest of
the tick. The mission recording does: it opens the tick there
(`Recorder::start_tick`), which first notes the commands and their messages on
the frame before the tick, exactly where they were noted when the handlers ran
between frames.
`World::step_observed` also calls a closure after the command phase, for a
driver that reports what a command did (the AI probe does).

Two things change timing. A command given from the menu while paused now
takes effect on the first tick after resuming, instead of at once. And the
mission recording must keep listing a command on the frame before the tick that
applies it, as it does today (done, above).

The step hands an order to `AiWings::command_at` with the sender's plane, and
the AI routes it to the sender's own wing (slice B3, built): AI members act on
it, a human member only records that it was ordered, and a plane that does not
lead its wing is refused.

*Agent decisions (B2):*

- A pause refuses chaff and flares in the app, since only the app knows about
  the pause. The other refusals (destroyed, ejected, no hit points) are the
  tick's.
- The commands apply in the order given. Before, weapon-page buttons ran at the
  tick and every other command ran at once, so two commands given in one frame
  could swap.
- The scope controls reach the flight before the seat's commands. The frame
  loop used to copy them after the handlers had run, so a command given in the
  same frame as a channel change saw the old channel; it now sees the new one.
- The queue holds at most 256 commands.
- The order call and the wing's reply are played after the tick that applied
  the order, not at once. What the order does to the radio channel happens in
  the command phase: the call cuts off the wing lines still playing on the
  seat's channel (the journal notes the cut) and holds that channel for its
  length, for every seat and whether or not a sound device plays it (John,
  2026-09-29). Before, only a live game with a sound device cut off and held,
  a live game without one only held, and the AI probe did neither; one probe
  output and its recording changed with this rule.

#### Combat: one ownship per human-flown aircraft

Built in B1 (`tore-sim/src/combat/live.rs`). `live::State` keeps what every
aircraft shares: projectiles, the target rows of AI aircraft and ground objects,
effects, smoke, debris, countermeasure devices, the ledger, the mission settings
(cheats, weapon rules, friendly fire) and combat's one random stream. The
player-only fields (stations and rounds, selection and arming, the mounted
seeker, sensors, trigger and gun cadence, bay requests, hit points, hit
sections, fault counts and failure flags, chaff and flares, missile warnings,
score) live in an `Ownship`, one per human-flown aircraft, held in aircraft id
order (`State::ownships`, `ownship(id)`, `own()` for hosts with one). The host
adds and removes them with `add_ownship(Ownship::new(id, side, config,
external))` and `remove_ownship(id)`, which gives back the stores, damage and
countermeasures as the ownship left them.

`State::step_surface` takes one `OwnshipInput { aircraft, held, launcher }` per
ownship. Every player-only stage loops over the ownships in id order: guns-only
and pending damage, sensors, the mounted seeker and readiness, firing, the hit
test and damage pipeline, smoke, fragments, threat observation and the midair
pool. An ownship without an input is not stepped that tick. Cockpit questions
(readiness, seeker tone, the display target, the weapon estimate) go through
`State::view(id)` / `OwnshipView`, and commands through `State::command(id, ..)`.
Player-only events carry the aircraft id (`Fired`, `OwnshipDamaged`,
`SubsystemDamaged`, `OwnshipDestroyed`, `PilotKilled`, `OwnshipGroundImpact`,
`Jolt`, `Strike::victim`), and an ownship's projectiles are owned by its aircraft
id. With one ownship this is the earlier code in the earlier order of random
draws: the baseline compare was SAME on every behaviour item after B1's first
three steps.

Every ownship is an aircraft to the others. Each step builds a target row for it
from its own launcher, and that row is what the other ownships' sensors observe
(radar, passive emitters), what their mounted seeker and guided missiles
consider, what rounds hit and what the midair pool collides. A second ownship is
therefore detected, designated, shot at and collided with like any AI aircraft.

**Damage rules follow the pilot.** A human-flown aircraft uses today's player
rules: twice the aircraft's hit points (native), the damage spread, instant kills
and system faults gated by the Damage cheat, and Invulnerable. An AI-flown
aircraft uses today's AI rules. *Agent proposal, approved by John on
2026-09-28:* this keeps single player exact and gives every human the toughness
the player has today.

`tore-world`'s `Combat` serves every human-flown plane (B1's last step).
`Combat::step_all` takes each human-flown plane's flight, in aircraft id order,
puts every launcher into one combat step, then hands each flight what combat did
to its aircraft: system faults, payload, bay, radar and jammer, damage and the
crash. Each ownship has its own trigger (`Combat::trigger(aircraft)`, the
keyboard's and the controller's), and commands, trigger releases and cockpit
questions name the aircraft (`command_for`, `cancel_for`); the first ownship, the
one the app presents, keeps the one-flight calls (`step`, `command`, `cancel`,
`own()`), the combat tape and the command notes. *Since D3c* the tape, the notes
and the host's engine outlets follow `Combat::host_plane()`, single player's
plane 0 while it has an ownship and none in an open mission, and the build, the
tick and the handoff never call the one-flight calls, which panic with no
ownship. `World::step` calls it with
every cockpit, and the radio reads each plane's own ownship: hit points for
`cockpit_alive`, designation, weapon selection and incoming missiles for the
crew voice, the shooter and weapon of each `Fired` event for the weapon call.
Every other human-flown plane is in the tick's render snapshot as an ordinary
aircraft (its model, pose, devices, damage and pilot) beside the AI's; with one
cockpit the snapshot is unchanged. `Combat::add_ownship(ownship, contrail
offsets)` and `remove_ownship(aircraft)` are the calls a handoff (B6) uses: the
ownship carries the stores, damage and countermeasures in and out, and
`Ownship::localized_damage` is public for it. The AI still flies against the
first ownship only (B3).

*Agent decisions in B1 (not settled by the brief):*

- One counter (`State::next_shot`) numbers every ownship's rounds, so two
  ownships never share a projectile number; with one ownship it counts as the
  ownship's own `shots` did.
- `Projectile::incoming` is now `Option<u32>`, the ownship a round was aimed at
  when released. It is aim metadata (ledger aim, the diagnostic round) and no
  longer decides who a round can hit.
- The diagnostic `Incoming` command fires a round owned by no aircraft
  (`INCOMING_OWNER`) that carries the selected station's weapon record.
- Jammer deception against hits on AI rows (a dev range flag) uses the first
  ownship's ECM record, as the only ownship's did.
- Radar contacts of another ownship and its warnings use the same code as AI
  targets; the AI's own world snapshot still sees the human through the AI
  bridge (B3).

#### Hit tests and friendly fire

Before B1 a gun round could hit any aircraft except its owner, on either side,
the player included. Missiles were split: one aimed at the player could hit only
the player, and any other could hit any aircraft row, its own launcher included,
but never the player.

Built in B1's fourth step (rule from John, 2026-09-28, single player included): **a
gun round can hit any aircraft except the one that fired it, and a missile or
bomb can hit any aircraft once its fuze has armed**, whether it is an aircraft
that gets in the way, a new target it shifts to or its own launcher. One search
covers every aircraft row and every ownship, and the nearest contact along the
round's path wins. This ended the missile split: an enemy missile aimed at the
player can hit a wingman in its path, a missile aimed at someone else can hit the
player, and a decoyed missile no longer keeps aiming its hit at the player alone.
Damage follows the pilot: a hit on an ownship goes through the player pipeline, a
hit on an AI row through the AI pipeline.

*Agent decisions:* a round that starts inside its own launcher's hit volume
(every rocket and bomb with no arming delay does) is not a hit, so it cannot
explode on its pylon; only a round that comes back into the volume from outside
counts. This matches John's words at the design review: "missiles should be
able to hit anything once it leaves the shooting aircraft". Easy aiming widens the volume of other aircraft, never the shooter's own.
Missile and bomb records in the synthetic test fixtures keep an arming delay of
zero, so their tests rely on that rule.

Friendly fire is a mission setting, `State::friendly_fire`. `On` is single
player's behaviour and the default. `Off`, a lobby choice, means no round damages
an aircraft of its shooter's side, the shooter included; the round passes through
and flies on. Each aircraft has a side: the host sets it on ownships
(`Ownship::new(.., side, ..)`) and on AI rows (`add_dummy(.., side)`, from the
wing's side), and `NO_SIDE` (ground objects, fixtures, rounds nobody owns) is
never spared. Collisions stay on whatever the setting (John, 2026-09-28).

*Found by B7b's fight test, fixed in its own commit:* a hit on an ownship went
through the player's damage pipeline but never reached the ledger, so a human who
shot down another human (or its own leader) was credited with nothing and a
friendly-fire kill of a human never showed in the debrief. Now a hit on an
ownship by another ownship's round records the shooter as the last hit on it, and
a destroyed ownship is a recorded kill, as a hit on an AI row already was. The
AI is credited too (John, 2026-09-29): an AI shooter's hit on an ownship is the
last hit on it and its kill is the AI's, so the debrief and the replay recorder,
which names the player's killer from the ledger, show it. Ten of single player's
probe recordings changed with this rule in the stage C chain, in that event only. The diagnostic
incoming round belongs to no aircraft and is credited to nobody. The ownship's
own score (`hits`, `kills`) still counts hits on AI rows only, as before.

A loss with no shooter credits nobody (lead's decision, 2026-09-29): a
human-flown aircraft lost to the map edge or to overspeed is
recorded as lost without credit (`Ledger::lose_without_credit`, in
`Combat::step_all`) even when a shooter hit it earlier, as an AI aircraft lost
that way is (`AiWings::lose_uncredited`). An ordinary crash still goes to the
last shooter.

#### Handoff between the AI and a human

A handoff is a command, applied at the start of a tick before any other
command: a human takes an aircraft (joining, or rejoining their reserved one),
or gives one back (leaving, dropping or being kicked). Releasing a reserved
aircraft changes only who may take it; the AI keeps flying it. Only a living
aircraft whose pilot is still aboard can change hands.

**AI to human:**

1. The AI actor leaves the AI mission. The other actors keep their order.
2. The flight state moves over unchanged: position, velocity, attitude, fuel,
   systems, damage, gear and flaps, flight-model internals and their random
   state.
3. The combat target row becomes an ownship: the same fraction of hit points
   under the player rule, the same hit-section fractions and fault counts, each
   station's rounds from the AI's stores (failed stations stay failed), chaff and
   flares from its dispensers. Its sensors and missile warnings move over; the
   AI's equipment failures become the ownship's failure flags.
4. The weapon follows a flight start's rule (the gun if it carries something,
   else the first loaded station Guns only allows, else NAV, the bug bash's
   rule), and the AI's current
   target is designated if the aircraft's sensors hold it (*agent proposal*).
   The autopilot is off, and the human's controls apply from this tick.
5. If the aircraft leads its wing, the human becomes the wing's leader and the
   AI wingmen follow. The AI's orders and assignments are dropped.
6. The seat's radio queue, crew voice and tower conversation follow the
   aircraft.

**Human to AI:**

1. The ownship becomes a combat target row with the same fractions, the reverse
   of the above. Its stores, dispensers, sensors and warnings go to a new AI
   actor, built as at mission start: same slot, the same seed rule, fresh
   awareness, neutral. It joins the actor list in id order.
2. A wingman rejoins its leader, and a leader follows the flight plan (the
   guide's rule for a dropped player).
3. The flight model stays as it is.

Handoff tests check that position and speed change by no more than one normal
tick of flight, that fuel and rounds are identical, and that hit points keep
their fraction to within one point.

*Built (B6).* The handoff is two calls on `World`, `take_plane(seat, plane)` and
`give_back_plane(seat)`, and the mission commands `MissionCommand::Take { seat,
plane }` and `GiveBack { seat }` that `step_with` applies first in the tick, in
the order given, before any seat's commands. `can_take` and `can_give_back` say
whether a handoff would go through; a refused one changes nothing, and inside a
tick it is an error the host sees, so a host checks first. Each seat's input is
checked against the planes as the commands leave them: a seat that takes a plane
sends input for that tick, and a seat that gives its plane back sends none.

The two conversions are in `tore-sim` combat (`live::Ownship::from_ai` and
`Ownship::into_ai`, in `combat/live/handoff.rs`); the world's half is
`world/handoff.rs`. What each field becomes:

| Kept | AI to human | Human to AI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hit points | The row's fraction of `initial_hp` becomes the same fraction of the configuration's `damage_capacity` (twice the hit points), never below 1 for a living aircraft | The reverse, into the configuration's `hit_points` |
| Damage taken, hit-section amounts, fault counts | Same fractions; the breakup variant and section copy over | Same, back |
| Station rounds | Each station's rounds from the AI's store (an unlimited store counts as the station's full count); a station out of action gets the ownship's failed mark | Rounds and the failed mark back into a store per station, built as at mission start |
| Chaff and flares | From the AI's radar and infrared dispensers | Back into the two dispensers |
| Sensors and missile warnings | Moved over as they are | Moved back |
| Avionics failures | The AI's radar, infrared, visual and RWR failures are the ownship's flags; a jammer the row lost is `ecm_failed` | The reverse |
| Flight state | Moves to the cockpit unchanged (autopilot off, mission cheats applied) | Moves to the actor unchanged (cheats cleared: an AI aircraft carries none) |

A living aircraft never rounds to zero hit points, so a handoff cannot kill it.
The round trip keeps rounds, chaff and flares exactly and hit points to within
one point.

*Agent decisions in B6 (not settled by the brief):*

- A station's failed mark is the AI's own record of a fault (`damaged_stations`),
  not the `inhibited` flag the Air combat guns only setting also raises, so
  switching that setting on does not fail a human's missiles for good. A store
  that arrives at the AI already inhibited is recorded as damaged.
- The cockpit of a taken plane starts fresh where the AI kept nothing: turbulence
  at its default and seeded as a restart seeds it, no selected airport, NAV mode
  off (the gun is armed), the result tracker on the mission's home base. The crew
  voice, airfield radio and crew label are built for the plane's aircraft type,
  which is found among the mission's other aircraft types; the combat
  configuration is the AI's own, else the mission's for that type, else a flown
  aircraft's.
- The AI's current target (the one it engages or searches for) is designated
  through combat's own designation, so it holds only if the aircraft's sensors
  hold the contact, and no tape or command note records it.
- The new actor takes the skill the aircraft had before a human took it, else
  a wingmate's, else the side's first AI aircraft's. It gets no assignment, as
  an aircraft at mission start has none before the mission preset and group
  objectives are applied, so a preset such as CAP or Hold does not reach an
  aircraft that comes back from a human, and it acts as under Free.
- Taking a plane with a lower id than the first ownship makes that one the
  first cockpit, whose plane the render history follows, so a host that
  presents one seat should reserve the lowest ids for it. (B6 also kept the
  lowest-numbered human plane from being given back; D3c lifted that: any
  plane can go, the last one too, and the tick runs with no human.)
- Only a plane whose row is alive and whose pilot is aboard changes hands, in
  both directions. A destroyed or ejected plane stays as it is.
- Rendering: a plane given back that has no drawn model among the mission's
  other aircraft (single player's plane 0 when its type is not one the wings
  fly) is hidden in the tick's picture until the app supplies a model for it.
  Combat's snapshot looks a row's model up by its place among the mission's
  other aircraft. In an open mission plane 0 is one of them, so it is drawn.

#### The AI with several humans

*Built (B3).* The host hands the AI one `HumanAircraft` for each human-flown
plane that has an ownship, in id order (`AiWings::step`): its `HumanSlot` (plane
id, side, wing and member, from the roster's `Plane.slot`), its flight state,
its ownship's hit points and the signature and jammer of its configuration.
The AI builds a world object with `human_controlled` set from each, where it
built one for "the player". A human is never an `AiActor`.

- **Snapshots and evidence.** Missile snapshots take one launcher per ownship,
  attack evidence from an aircraft's RWR, emitters and sensors is delivered to
  that aircraft alone, `locks_on(id)` lists the locks on one aircraft, and a
  launch aimed at any human is `incoming` for it. Decoy rolls and compatibility
  threat reports read the weapon of the round's own owner, never plane 0's.
- **External leaders.** A wing whose current leader is human-flown has that human
  as its external leader, so AI wingmen fly formation on any human lead, not
  only on Friendly Wing 1. Each step refreshes the AI's list of humans
  (`AiMission::set_humans`), so a human that leaves stops leading.
- **Landing priority.** Every human keeps landing priority over AI traffic:
  `World::step` evaluates every cockpit in id order
  (`AiWings::update_landing_priority(id, ..)`), a claim keeps its runway busy
  and a joining wingman's wing-abort reads its own leader's claim.
- **Assignments.** Mission assignments and must-survive lists are kept for each
  human (`human_assignment(id)`, `must_survive(id)`). The presets and group
  stamps write every human they name: Escort and Intercept name every friendly
  human, a group stamp reaches only the humans in that group, and a survival list
  is written for every human. *Agent decision.*
- **Friendly lists.** `AiWings::friendly_ids(side)` lists a side's AI and human
  aircraft; `World::refresh_friendlies` gives each ownship its own side's list
  (restart calls it; a handoff calls it again).
- **Orders.** Wing orders, `next_formation` and the landing orders take the
  sender's plane and go to the sender's own wing, to AI and human members
  alike; a human member answers "flown by a human". Only the plane that leads its
  wing can order it (*agent decision*, following "orders from a seat whose
  aircraft leads its wing" below).
- **Numbering.** A wing with humans in it leaves their member numbers free of AI
  aircraft: the k-th AI member takes the k-th number no human holds
  (`AiWings::build_for`). One human at member 0 of Friendly Wing 1 is the old
  shift by one.
- **Contact reports.** A contact carries its group size and advice once and its
  clock position, elevation, range and type name measured from each human
  (`Contact::views`), for a radio that voices each seat's report; the plain
  fields are the first human's. *Agent decision:* B4 has not adopted `views`
  yet.
- **Return to base** (the bug bash's rule of 2026-09-29). A wing led by a human
  stays with its human (the AI skips any wing with an external leader).
  *Agent decision:* an AI-led wing with a human wingman goes home like any
  AI-led wing, and the human is never ordered. An ejected human counts as lost
  in return to base, traffic avoidance and succession, as an ejected AI pilot
  does: ejecting ends the aircraft's flight (`crashed`), which both the human's
  world object and an AI actor read.

*Removing and inserting actors, for handoff.* `AiWings::remove_actor(id)` takes
an AI aircraft out and returns its flight state, stores, dispensers, sensors,
missile warnings, equipment faults, skill and combat configuration; the others
keep their order. `AiWings::insert_actor` adds an aircraft in id order as at
mission start: same slot, the seed rule (its rank among the wing's member
numbers no human holds), fresh awareness, neutral, home the nearest runway its
side may use. It leads if it is its wing's leader, and takes its member number
as its formation slot, or its rank behind the leader once the flight has
re-formed. `ActorInsert::from_removed` puts an actor back as it left. The
preset assignment is not re-applied (*agent decision*). Both calls are for the
lead's handoff and have no caller yet.

#### Lead succession

John's rule (2026-09-28): if a flight lead is shot down, a human in the flight
takes the lead if there is one; otherwise the next AI member does, and the
flight re-forms on the new leader.

*Built (B3).*

- Each wing has a current leader, `AiMission::wing_leader`. At the start of the
  mission it is the wing's member 0 (a wing with no member 0 has none, as before).
  When the leader's aircraft is destroyed or its pilot ejects, lead passes on that
  tick to the lowest-numbered flying human member, or, if there is none, to the
  lowest-numbered flying AI member. The check runs at the start of every mission
  step, before anyone decides whom to follow, and again at its end, so a leader
  lost during the tick hands over on that tick. A wing with nobody left keeps its
  last leader.
- `ActorIdentity::leads` is the flag `is_leader()` reads; `member` stays the
  fixed roster number. The flight re-forms: the followers, human and AI, take
  formation slots 1, 2 and so on in member order. A member that was following
  the lost leader in to land stops, as the bug bash's succession did; this rule
  replaced the bug bash's renumbering at John's decision of 2026-09-29.
- Everything in the AI that keys on "the leader" reads the current leader instead
  of member 0: `leader_view` and the external leader, airfield clearance,
  escorts, automatic release, the contact report hold rule (the leader and the
  first wingman behind it report) and orders.
- A `LeadershipChange` in the mission output (wing, new leader, previous leader,
  whether the previous leader's pilot is alive: ejected and unhurt) becomes a
  `Chatter::Leadership` event, and the radio journals it (`Cause::Leadership`).
  For an AI new leader that is all there is.

*Mission of opportunity (aircraft pass, John's decision of 2026-09-30).* When
a human's lead passes to an AI aircraft, `refresh_leaders` starts an
`ai::opportunity::Opportunity` for the wing (`AiMission::begin_opportunity`):
the wing's AI members get free engagement and lose any recall, or, under
weapons hold or self-defense, the wing goes home at once. Each step,
`AiMission::fly_opportunities` runs right after the first leadership check: it
pools the hostile aircraft every living member sees or remembers
(`awareness::Memory`), and `Opportunity::step` keeps one last known point per
enemy aircraft and picks the one to search. The lead's controller gets it
through `Controller::set_wing_search` and flies it with the lost-contact search
(`MotionBranch::Search` with `opportunity: true`), after its own lost contact
and never as a target. When the search is over the lead flies the wing's
remaining waypoints (`Plan::Route`, `Controller::set_wing_route`,
`MotionBranch::WingRoute`), which the host hands over with
`AiMission::set_wing_route` (`AiWings::set_wing_route` by aircraft) and the
opportunity copies when the lead passes. *No host has a route yet:* Quick
Mission imports no mission route and the AI flies none, so only the probe's
`--probe-wing-route` calls it (agent decision: the plumbing waits for route
import rather than inventing routes). With no waypoint left,
`AiMission::send_home` (the same call the mission's return to base uses) lands
every airborne member at its home runway, or flies a lead with none home, and `airfield_clearance` keeps a
member still in `Phase::Waiting` parked. The numbers are agent decisions,
in the [AI spec](spec/ai.md#mission-of-opportunity-after-a-lost-human-leader).
A wing led by AI from the start is untouched. The AI probe prints a
`mission of opportunity:` line whenever what the wing does changes.
*Agent decision:* the rule is the same for every seat, since it keys on a
human's lead passing to AI, and no seat hears anything new.

A human new leader hears "You're the Wingleader now" (`^WNGLDR`, already
imported) five seconds later, spoken by the previous leader if that pilot is
still alive, for example after ejecting (retail: "voiced only when the previous
leader is still alive to send it"). Otherwise a HUD line only (*agent
proposal*; retail's triggers are unknown, see the
[radio chatter spec](spec/radio-chatter.md#youre-the-wingleader-now)).
*Built (B4 step 4).* `Radio::chatter` turns B3's `Chatter::Leadership` into
the call when `scene.human(new leader)` is a listener: a call to that seat
alone (`Audience::Plane`), five seconds later even if the previous leader is
human, important, voiced by the previous leader or, when that pilot is dead,
text only under the label `Flight`. When the AI takes the lead the existing
"now leads the wing" note is all there is (no call, no unheard entry), so
single player, where a human never becomes the new leader, is unchanged.
`radio_calls::leaders` reads the AI mission's current leader (`wing_leader`)
for the flight-leader audience.

Single player gained the same succession (John, 2026-09-28): when the player is
shot down, the first living wingman leads the rest, and when an AI leader dies
its next living member leads. It landed as its own commit with re-recorded
baselines. In the stage C chain, where it replaced the bug bash's succession,
it changed 33 of the 49 default probe recordings and 7 printed outputs. In 27
recordings only the journal's "now leads the wing" note differs (and, in one,
the "leader" or "wingman" word in the AI thinking record). In six, aircraft move
from the tick a wing changes leader, where the two rules differ: a wing whose
human leader is lost passes the lead to its first living wingman (the bug bash
left a human-led wing alone), which releases the wingmen to engage and refuses
the dead player's later wing order; and an AI wing keeps its members' numbers
where the bug bash renumbered them.

#### Radio, orders and debrief for each seat

- **Radio.** Each call is still generated once, with one variant roll and the
  same cooldowns, so every listener hears the same variant, as in retail. The
  listener rule then runs for each seat, against that seat's aircraft and
  flight, and each seat has its own delivery queue and busy hold. The crew voice
  and the tower run for each human-flown aircraft. With one seat this is today's
  radio.

  *Built (B4 step 1).* `radio_calls::step` gets the listeners (one `Listener`
  per human-flown plane: its seat, plane, radio flight, side, whether it is
  alive, its position and crew label) and the radio names of every plane
  (`radio_calls::members`, built from the roster so a human-flown plane has one
  too). `Radio::say` rolls and words a call once, asks the listener rule for
  each listener's label, and hands `Comms::send` the call with its hearers.
  `Comms` holds one channel per seat (queue of at most 64, busy hold, radio
  silence, the lines still audible for a cut-off) beside what is shared: the
  variant stream, the cooldowns, the call numbers and the journal. `Comms::due`
  returns `Delivery { seat, call }`, and `Cue::Radio` carries the seat, so a
  presenter shows only its own seat's lines. The journal has one entry per
  call, numbered once, and its `heard_by` names the seats it is about (queued,
  dropped by radio silence, delivered). Agent decisions: a seat hears a
  whole-flight call from any other plane of its wing while it is alive, hears a
  flight-leader call only if it flies the wing's leader (its first member until
  lead succession lands), and hears a friendly-fire complaint only if it is
  the shooter's seat; a human-flown plane's own calls are voiced at once; radio
  silence is each seat's own setting; the crew's missile-warning limit is
  kept for each seat, since two crews warn separately; a call no seat hears is
  one `Unheard` journal entry; a wingman's contact report is one call whose
  clock position, height, range and type naming are each seat's own, from B3's
  `Contact::views` (`Hearer::saying` gives a seat its own words).

  *Built (B4 step 2).* Each `Cockpit` holds a `CrewVoice` and an
  `AirfieldRadio`, both made for its seat and plane. `World::step_radio` runs
  each cockpit's tower conversation, then `WingStatus` (what the AI wingmen
  report from the airfield, decided once and handed to every cockpit in that
  wing), then each cockpit's delivery and crew voice, then the weapon, hit and
  wing calls, then the calls due. With one cockpit that is today's order and
  today's rolls. The crew voice's wingman is the first other member of the
  plane's own wing, by the roster's slot; for member 1 of a wing that is
  today's rule, which keeps a dead wingman from being replaced by the next
  (agent decision: the brief said "first other living member", which would
  change single player when a two-ship leader's wingman dies in a larger
  wing). Combat's player-only state (designation, weapon selection, incoming
  missiles) is still the first cockpit's, so `crew_voice::Host::ownship` is false
  for the other cockpits until B1 lands.
- **Orders.** Alt-key orders from a seat whose aircraft leads its wing go to that
  wing, to human and AI members alike. A human wingman gets the order as text and
  the recording. Reply and request keys for human wingmen are stage F.
- **Debrief.** Built for each seat, with that seat's aircraft as the pilot column
  and the first other member of its wing as the wingman column. The full
  multiplayer results screen is stage F.

  *Built (B5 step 1).* `tore_world::debrief::capture(&World, SeatId)` builds the report of
  the plane the seat flies (`None` for a seat that flies none). The pilot column
  is that plane: its hit points come from its ownship and its pilot state from
  its cockpit's flight. The wingman column is `debrief::wingman_of`, the first
  other member of the plane's wing by the roster's slot, human-flown or not. The
  objectives are `outcome::Requirements::of` for the plane, and friendly fire
  counts the kills the plane made. Every other human-flown plane is an ordinary
  aircraft of the ending, friendly when it flies the seat's side. The app asks
  for `SEAT`, seat 0, in the game, at the end of a recording and in the AI
  probe, which is today's debrief exactly. The success rule exists once, in
  `outcome::Standing` (`tore-world`): the debrief's `report` and the in-flight
  result check both read it, so the music, the radio calls and the debrief
  cannot disagree. *Agent decisions:* the mission still holds one assignment
  for the human (B3 makes it per plane), so every seat reads it; a seat that
  flies for the enemy side is supported by the debrief (its targets are the
  other side's aircraft) but the in-flight result check still assumes the
  friendly side until B3 gives planes a side there.
- **Mission result call.** The "mission accomplished" and "almost home" calls
  become `World` output for every seat (John, 2026-09-28). They used to be sent
  only when an audio device existed, so with `--no-audio` their HUD lines and
  recording entries now appear. The retail "mission failure" call is not part of
  this: TORE has never sent it, the in-flight trigger for a lost mission is
  unknown (see the [radio chatter spec](spec/radio-chatter.md#not-implemented-and-why)),
  and nothing here invents one.

  *Built (B4 step 3).* Each `Cockpit` holds an `outcome::Tracker`
  (`ai_wings/outcome.rs`): the 4 second result check, the rule that a result
  already decided at the first check disables the calls and the music's SUCC and
  HOME, and the home check. `World::step_results` runs it for every human-flown
  plane at the end of the tick's radio phase, with `outcome::succeeded`, which
  is the debrief's success rule (`outcome::Standing`) for that plane (no friendly aircraft shot
  down by it, every aircraft to destroy gone, every aircraft to protect flying;
  the mission's assignment is still the one for plane 0 until B3). It sends the
  call to the plane's seat after the tick's due calls, so it is delivered on the
  next tick, as the music's host did. The situation music keeps choosing music
  and reads the tracker's status (`Tracker::status`) instead of running its
  own. Agent decisions: every seat shares the mission's home base (the
  ground-start airport); the AI probe declares a mission start
  (`Setup::mission`) so its recordings carry the calls the live game sends.

#### Flight model in multiplayer

A mission setting chooses the flight model of AI aircraft. `Standard` is single
player as today: AI aircraft fly the legacy model, except wingmen that start on
the ground and aircraft that begin a landing. `AllHybrid`, for every multiplayer
mission (John, 2026-09-28), puts every AI aircraft on the hybrid model at mission
start, seeded as the AI probe's `--probe-flight-model researched` does, so a
human taking over an AI aircraft never feels its handling change. AI air combat
on the hybrid model was checked with 336 AI probe runs against the legacy model,
measured again at `663ac82` after the bug battery changed the AI: two more enemy
aircraft lost (255 against 253), one more friendly AI aircraft lost (27 against
26) and the same rounds fired (913) over 168 encounters on each, and no encounter
differs by more than one aircraft or one round. The earlier B7 measurement at
`42b3d76` had the same enemy losses, 23 friendly against 22 and 911 rounds
against 912. See [the comparison](baselines/ai-hybrid-2026-09-29.md).

*Built (B3).* `ai_wings::AiFlightModel` is the setting: `AiSetup::flight_model`
in `world.rs` (single player passes `Standard`) and the probe's
`--probe-ai-flight-model standard|all-hybrid`. `AllHybrid` gives every AI
aircraft that is not on the hybrid model yet the researched adapter, seeded
`1 + aircraft id` as the probe seeds its researched actors, and the same
seeding applies to an aircraft inserted later. Training targets, which only
drift on a straight line, stay as they are, and `Standard` cannot undo
`AllHybrid` (*agent decisions*). On the 41 default probes `AllHybrid` leaves 10
recordings identical (those already on the researched model, and the wing-only
ground start) and changes 31: the seven ground starts differ by fractions of a
knot in wings other than the player's, and the 24 air fights diverge from the
first tick with small shifts in launches and hits. The full comparison is the
one linked above.

#### Single-player guarantee

Single player keeps its results tick for tick through stages A and B, checked
by the baseline harness after every commit. These changes are the exceptions,
approved by John on 2026-09-28. Each lands as its own commit with re-recorded
baselines:

1. The AI probe's output, when it switches to the full tick.
2. The missile hit rule.
3. Lead succession.
4. The mission result calls ("mission accomplished" and "almost home", the two
   that exist) without an audio device.
5. The wing order call holds the radio channel whatever the audio (approved by
   John on 2026-09-29).
6. Kill credit for every shooter of a human-flown aircraft, the AI included
   (approved by John on 2026-09-29).

Presentation only, with no change to simulation or recordings: per-camera
weather, wing vapor, blackout and redout, the view rig and control-surface
sounds read the end of the tick (stage A), and a menu command given while paused
applies when play resumes (stage B).

#### How stage B lands

1. **B0** (lead): the types above and the registry, with seat 0 flying aircraft
   0. No behaviour change. Done: `seats.rs`, `World::roster`, `World::cockpits`
   and `World::step(&[SeatInput])`.
2. In parallel, each owning its own files:
   - **B1 combat**: ownships, events with aircraft ids, the hit rule and friendly
     fire setting (`tore-sim` combat, `tore-world`'s `combat.rs`).
   - **B2 seat input**: every between-tick command becomes a seat command (the
     world's input path and `main.rs`'s handlers). Done: see
     [seat input](#seat-input).
   - **B3 AI**: several humans, current leaders and succession, the actor
     removal and insertion handoff needs, and the flight-model setting
     (`tore-sim` AI, `ai_wings`). Done: see [the AI with several
     humans](#the-ai-with-several-humans).
   - **B4 radio**: the listener rule, queues, crew voice and tower for each seat.
   - **B5 debrief and recorder**: both for a chosen seat.
3. **B6** (lead): handoff, with its tests. Done: see [handoff between the AI
   and a human](#handoff-between-the-ai-and-a-human).
4. **B7**: the tests that close stage B. Done. B7a: every seat-specific tick
   output names its seat (see [tick input and output](#tick-input-and-output)).
   B7b, in `crates/tore-world/src/world/`, on the crowded mission of `crowd.rs`
   (two humans and two AI wingmen in each of two wings, the humans handed their
   planes through the handoff):
   - `fight_tests.rs` flies the four seats through a 3,000 tick fight with
     scripted stick, radar and gun bursts. It shows the run repeats exactly (a
     digest of every plane, ownship, AI row and the radio journal), every
     human's sensors see the other humans, ownships hit ownships of either side
     (friendly fire on, and a setting that spares a shooter's own side) and AI
     aircraft, the AI wingmen fly on their human leader, also once the friendly
     lead is shot down and passes to the other human, each seat hears only its
     own radio and gets its own HUD lines, and each seat's debrief inputs
     (`ai_wings::outcome`) name its own plane.
   - `succession_tests.rs` covers an AI leader shot down (the next AI member
     leads that tick, the flight re-forms, nothing is said), a human leader shot
     down or ejected with a human wingman (that seat alone hears "You're the
     Wingleader now" five seconds later, voiced by the previous leader when the
     pilot ejected alive and a text line when not) and a human leader shot down
     with only AI wingmen (the first living AI member leads).
   - The hybrid probe comparison is
     [ai-hybrid-2026-09-29](baselines/ai-hybrid-2026-09-29.md).
   - The fight test found one bug, fixed in its own commit: a hit by one ownship on
     another never reached the ledger (see [hit tests and friendly
     fire](#hit-tests-and-friendly-fire)).

### How stage C landed

Stage C (built 2026-09-29) brought the overnight bug bash into the multiplayer
work. The bug bash had gone to `main` (81dee6b) while stages A and B were
written against the old `main`, and both had reshaped the same code: the tick,
combat, the AI bridge, the debrief and the recorder.

- **Rebuilt, not merged.** The 66 multiplayer commits were replayed one by one on
  the new `main`, so history stays linear and every commit builds. The bug bash's
  code moved along with each refactor: where stage A moved the tick, combat or the
  recorder, the bug bash's edits to that code went to the new place in the same
  commit.
- **Segment by segment.** The replay ran in segments, each ending at a checkpoint:
  the build, the tests and the behaviour baseline, compared with a canonical
  recording of the new chain. Refactor segments had to be SAME. The planned
  changes (listed under [single-player guarantee](#single-player-guarantee)) were
  re-measured in their own commits, each difference explained.
- **The bug bash's player rules apply to every human-flown plane.** They went
  in the commit that makes that state per seat, not onto seat 0 alone:
  - The tick's rules (world-edge warning and loss, OVERSPEED message)
    run for each cockpit in `World::step`, and their messages, and the gear ground
    sensor's, are cues addressed to that seat.
  - Combat state the bug bash added (empty stations and the selection ring,
    start-up weapon selection, `Invulnerable`) lives on each
    `Ownship`, with the loss causes on each.
  - The kill ledger credits nobody for a loss with no shooter (world edge,
    overspeed), for any aircraft, humans included, even if a shooter
    hit it earlier. The AI kill credit of stage B does not bring credit back for
    these.
  - The debrief's Cause row and friendly-objective side are per seat, and the
    recorder writes the loss cause and external fuel for each recorded seat.
  - The AI's return to base, traffic avoidance and wing abort see every human
    plane, and a human-led wing stays with its human. The AI's world-edge and
    overspeed losses credit nobody.
  - The HUD's BAY and time-rate readouts and the flight-start rules read the
    presented seat's state.
- **Lead succession.** Both branches had built it. Multiplayer's rule kept
  (John, 2026-09-29): every aircraft keeps its number and callsign, a human in the
  flight leads before an AI member, and a human is told. The bug bash's
  renumbering was retired, and its one extra behaviour was ported: a wingman that
  was following the lost leader in to land stops, since the new leader must not
  keep the landing. In single player, AI wings pick the same new leader but keep
  their numbers.
- **Later moves onto `main` rebase this branch itself.** rerere holds only the
  conflict hunks of the replay, not a whole resolved history, so a later bug-bash
  fix is rebased onto the rebuilt branch, not replayed from stage A again.

## Flight data link

Design for stage G of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written on 2026-10-05. Slices G0 (the radar table and the picture), G1 (the
engagement table), G3a (assignments and their calls), G2 (humans in the
table), G6 (the cues), G3b (assignments reach the AI), G3c (the sort order), G4 (AI leads share and sort, linked AI yield), G8 (the nets), G9 (the replay events) and G7 (the wire, protocol 15) are built; the AI reads the picture for the humans' locked
targets, for the track of an assigned target, and, for an AI lead, for the bandits its side knows and its wingmen's state; the rest is not built ([the slice table](#how-stage-g-lands) marks each slice that is). What the player sees and
hears, who shares what and the numbers are in the guide,
[DATALINK.md](DATALINK.md); the bytes
are in the [wire protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#data-link-stage-g). Every
choice here is an agent decision unless it is credited to John. John's rules
(2026-09-28, [guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#flight-data-link)): one shared picture per
flight that AI and humans read and write alike, also in single player; the
tracks at 4 Hz, locks and assignments at once; assignments voiced with
bearing and range from the receiver. John dropped the era gating on
2026-10-05: all friendlies get the data link whatever their aircraft type, and
the one thing the type decides is whether it has a radar (below). Stage G is a **planned single-player change**: the slices that
change single player are listed in [the table](#how-stage-g-lands), each with
its own baseline comparison.

In short:

- A new `DataLink` in `World` (`crates/tore-world/src/datalink.rs`) owns the
  picture: the members and their radar flags, the engagements, locks and
  assignments (changed at once), and the tracks and member state (published
  every 30 ticks). It observes the human ownships after combat and the AI
  actors after the AI step, and never changes either.
- **No tiers (John, 2026-10-05).** Every aircraft of a side is a linked member,
  in its flight and over the side's battle net. The aircraft table is one flag,
  `has_radar`, pure data in `tore-sim` (`crates/tore-sim/src/datalink.rs`),
  keyed by `AircraftId::source()`, read by the world and the displays. An
  aircraft with no radar is still linked and its AI uses the picture as any
  other; its player sees every link cue but the radar scope's marks (slice G6,
  John, 2026-10-05).
  There are no pair rules and no "least capable member".
- The AI's one read of other controllers in target choice, the wing attacker
  count, moves onto an engagement table kept in decision order, with
  identical results; later slices then let the picture change what the AI
  does, one rule at a time.
- Orders become assignments: delivered by link (the target), and always
  voiced, from the receiver's geometry. The design's voice-only delivery to
  older aircraft, with a heard point to search, was for the tiers and is
  **dropped** by John's decision of 2026-10-05.
- The seat's share of the picture rides in its cockpit readout; changes go as
  events at once.

### Where the code stands

Surveyed at `884f9916` on `multiplayer`. Line numbers are indicative.

- **The AI reads one thing from other controllers to choose a target.**
  `AiMission::step_actor` (`crates/tore-sim/src/ai/mission.rs`, about line
  2492) lists the `controller.target()` of every living AI actor of the same
  side and wing, live, in actor order, and sets each candidate's
  `TargetView::wing_attackers` from it (about line 2706). The ranking adds the
  [B41](spec/ai.md#b41-target-retention-eligibility-and-ranking) penalties
  (`ai::targeting::candidate_score`; the allowance is fixed at two in
  `Controller::select_target`). Earlier actors' targets are this tick's, later
  ones last tick's, which is the AI's same-tick decision visibility that John
  kept on 2026-10-02 ([performance](#ai-observation-and-ordered-decisions)).
  Humans are not counted.
- **Other cross-actor reads**, none of them a picture: `leader_view` copies the
  leader's target into `LeaderView::target`, which nothing reads; the mission of
  opportunity pools the members' awareness memory (`fly_opportunities`, about
  line 1881); escorts receive attack evidence a tick later; the traffic and
  formation reads are kinematics. The bridge reads AI controllers for
  presentation: `AiWings::locks_on` and `aiming_at`
  (`crates/tore-world/src/ai_wings.rs`, about lines 1472 and 1500) for the RWR
  tone and the music, `observe_chatter` (`ai_wings/chatter.rs`, about line 353)
  for contact reports and `set_actor_supports` for seekers.
- **Leader sharing was specified but not connected** (the survey's finding;
  slice G4 connected it). `wing::leader_shares_target` and
  `wing::share_targets` (`ai/wing.rs`, about lines 334 to 380) implement
  B43's loose-control share and had no caller.
- **Orders.** `World::wing_order` (`world/commands.rs`, about line 255) calls
  `AiWings::command_at` (`ai_wings/orders.rs`, about line 342), which turns
  Engage my target and Engage from formation into
  `TargetOrder::ConcreteTarget` and refused a wingman whose own sensors lack
  the target (`Answered::CannotSeeTarget`, about line 512; since slice G3b it
  takes the two Engage orders when the picture holds a track of the target). The sender's call
  was one stem, `^ATTACK` (`sender_stem`, about line 967), played at once as
  `Cue::OrderVoice`, which cuts off wing lines and holds the channel; since
  slice G3a it is the assignment call (below) and the order feeds
  `DataLink::assign`.
- **Radio.** `Call` (`comms.rs`) has a label, text, stems, kind (chatter or
  important) and route, and no net. `Comms::send` takes per-seat `Hearer`s,
  each with its own label and words, which is how a contact report gives each
  seat its own clock position. `comms::number` and `comms::miles` already
  speak numbers and ranges by retail's rules; `^BEARING`, `^ANGELS` and the
  colours `^RED` to `^WHITE` are imported and unused.
- **Displays.** Everything the radar, target window and HUD draw comes from
  the seat's `CockpitReadout` (`crates/tore-world/src/readout.rs`, about line
  55), which the host sends in 26 delta-coded parts
  (`crates/tore-session/src/wire/readout.rs`, `PARTS`, about line 266). The
  radar's contacts carry no side and no "locked by"
  (`crates/tore-app/src/scope.rs`, `instruments.rs` page 9); the HUD box has
  one extra shape, the friendly X (`weapon_hud::draw_target_box`).
- **No capability data.** No era, avionics or link field exists.
  `sensors::profile::Preset` and `Generation` are gameplay groupings of the
  radar and jammer and must not be read as an era.

| Where | New or changed | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tore-sim/src/datalink.rs` | new | `has_radar(AircraftId)` (an exhaustive match on `id.source()`); later `datalink/sort.rs`, the sort as pure geometry |
| `tore-sim/src/ai/link.rs` | new | What the AI reads and writes: `Engagements` (the decision-order table), `LinkInput` (what the world hands the AI each tick), `lock_of(actor)` (the one lock rule), the AI's link outputs |
| `tore-sim/src/ai/mission_leads.rs` | new (G4) | What an AI lead does with the picture: `AiMission::lead_commits` (share and sort), `yield_target`, the actor's yields |
| `tore-world/src/datalink.rs` and `datalink/` | new | `DataLink`: members, picture, locks, engagements, assignments, sort warnings; `before_ai` and `after_ai`; per-seat views; the AI's input; the assignment calls; a write-only journal |
| `tore-world/src/world/datalink_leads.rs` | new (G4) | The AI leads' assignment calls, and the yields handed to the AI |
| `tore-world/src/world.rs` | changed | The `datalink` field and its two calls in `step_with` |
| `tore-world/src/readout.rs` | changed | `CockpitReadout::link`, the seat's share |

| `tore-app` | changed | The radar, target window and HUD cues; Alt+A and Alt+N; the replay events |

`tore-sim` holds what the AI must decide with; `tore-world` holds the picture
because it sees humans and AI alike (humans are not `AiActor`s, and their
sensors live in `combat.state`'s ownships). Neither depends on anything new.

### The picture

```rust
// tore-world/src/datalink.rs (sketch)
pub struct DataLink {
    members: Vec<Member>,             // every plane: id, flight, member, aircraft, radar, human, alive, position
    pictures: Vec<FlightPicture>,     // one per flight, as last published
    locks: BTreeMap<u32, Lock>,       // plane -> { target, since }
    engaged: BTreeMap<u32, u32>,      // plane -> target it attacks
    assignments: BTreeMap<u32, Assignment>, // receiver -> { target, by, tick, order, acknowledged }
    warned: BTreeSet<(u32, u32, u32)>,       // lock pairs already warned: (plane, plane, target)
    seat_warned: BTreeMap<SeatId, u64>,      // last sort warning tick per seat
    journal: Journal,                 // write-only, drained by the recorder
}
pub struct FlightPicture { flight: WingId, tick: u64, tracks: Vec<Track>, status: Vec<MemberStatus> }
pub struct Track { reporter: u32, target: u32, position: [f64; 3], velocity: [f64; 3], channel: Channel, observed: u64 }
```

Collections are `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet` and `Vec` in id order, as every mission
type is; nothing rolls a random number. A **member** is every plane of the
roster (`seats::Roster`), AI or human; its radar flag comes from its aircraft
type and never changes, and `alive` follows combat. **Engagements** are an AI's
`controller.target()` and a human's locked target (`Ownship::sensors.acquired()`).
A **lock** is a human's acquired target, or an AI's target while its weapon
service is tracking or firing (`ai::link::lock_of`, the rule `locks_on` uses
today). **Tracks** are, for a human, the hostile aircraft among its radar,
infrared and visual contacts, and for an AI the hostile aircraft in its
awareness's current observations (`awareness::Memory::current_observations`),
with the observed position and velocity. A flight's picture keeps its 32
tracks nearest its lead, one per target, the freshest report winning, ties to
the lower reporter id.

**What a member receives** is computed from the picture, never stored per
member: `DataLink::view(plane)` for the readout, `DataLink::ai_input()` for the
AI. Every living member of the side is linked: the locks and tracks of the whole
side reach a plane, and its flight's engagements, assignments and member state.
The radar flag is reported in the view for the displays and changes nothing it
receives ([who shares it](DATALINK.md#who-shares-it)).

### One tick

`World::step_with` (`world.rs`, about line 604) gains two calls. Nothing else
moves.

```

- **Commands** (step 1). `World::wing_order` asks `DataLink::assign` for the
  addressed members and the order's targets (the designation, or a sort), then
  hands each AI member its target through `command_at` as `ConcreteTarget`. The call is made here,
  as the order voice is today.
- **`before_ai`** runs after combat's events (step 10) and before the AI
  (step 11). It refreshes each member's `alive`, reads every ownship's lock and
  contacts, and on ticks divisible by 30 publishes each flight's tracks and
  member state: the humans' as they are now, the AI's as their last step left
  them. Then it hands the AI its input (`AiWings::set_link`), as `set_humans`
  hands it the humans.
- **The AI step** is unchanged in order. Inside it, the engagement table is
  updated as each actor decides (below).
- **`after_ai`** reads every AI actor's lock and target, takes the AI's link
  outputs (an AI lead's assignments, a yield), marks assignments acknowledged
  (the receiver locked the target) and clears finished ones, finds new sort
  warnings, and sends the calls and cues. It runs before the radio (step 13),
  so calls made in the tick are queued in the tick, as the wing's chatter is.

A tick's picture is published from state that every platform computes the same
way, at fixed ticks, so a host and a restored checkpoint agree, and the
published tracks are always the same age within a tick whoever reads them.

### How the AI reads the picture

**The engagement table (slice G1, single player unchanged).**
`ai::link::Engagements` is built at the start of `AiMission`'s decision loop
from every living actor's target, and each actor's entry is rewritten right
after that actor decides. At any actor's turn the table therefore holds what
the live scan returns today: earlier actors' new targets, later actors' old
ones. `step_actor` reads `wing_attackers` from the table instead of scanning
`self.actors`, and `leader_view` takes the leader's target from it. A test keeps
a copy of the old scan and compares it with the table for every actor of every
tick over seeded fights; the baseline must be SAME. `locks_on` and the picture
call `lock_of`, so the RWR and the picture share one lock rule. `aiming_at`
calls `engagement_of`, the rule under it (a living actor's target): the music
asks for a ready guided store, not a lock, and keeps doing so (agent decision,
slice G1).

The mission of opportunity's pool (`fly_opportunities`) stays as it is: it is a
wing's memory, pooled by what pilots say after losing their lead, not the
link, and it was built that way on John's decision of 2026-09-30.

**What the picture then adds**, each its own slice:

| Read | Today | After stage G | Slice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Who else attacks a candidate | Same-wing AI controllers, live | The engagement table, with the flight's humans' locked targets added at the start of the step | G1 (same result), G2 (humans, built) |
| An assigned target the wingman cannot see | Refused, "cannot see the target" | Accepted, flown toward the freshest track in the picture until its own sensors hold it | G3b (built) |
| A lead's share | Not connected | B43's loose-control share, through the picture, voiced | G4 (built) |
| Several bandits at the merge | Each wingman ranks on its own | An AI lead sorts; AI members yield on a sort warning | G4 (built) |
| Wingmen's state | Not read | An AI lead skips Winchester, bingo and heavily damaged wingmen | G4 (built) |

*Dropped (John, 2026-10-05).* The design had a **heard point** for Voice-tier
wingmen: the spoken bearing, range and height turned back into a point to
search, with a match radius, a 60-second deadline and a "Tally Ho" reply. With
no tiers every wingman takes the target, so nothing needs it.

**A track pursuit (built, G3b)**: the controller's target is the assigned id, and
while its own awareness lacks that id the frame's target view is built from
the freshest track in `LinkInput` (position, velocity, `observed`
tick, flagged as a link track so weapons never fire on it: a launch still
needs the actor's own lock). `LinkInput::pursuits` holds one `Pursuit` for each
AI wingman whose assignment the picture holds a track for; `AiMission::step_actor`
turns it into a `TargetView` with `link_track: true` (the track carried forward
to the tick at its own velocity) and adds it to the targets the engagement
policy and the controller choose from, so the order's target is kept like any
seen target. The controller's weapons see no target for a link view, and
everything that reads the actor's own sensors keeps the observed targets only.

### Assignments

`DataLink::assign(sender, order, addressed, designation)` returns one
`Assignment` per addressed wingman:

- Engage my target and Engage from formation: the sender's designation (a
  human) or target (an AI), for each addressed member; refused as today when
  there is no living hostile target.
- Sort (`PlayerOrder::Sort`, Alt+A): `tore_sim::datalink::sort` hands the
  hostile aircraft the side's picture holds within 40 nm of the sender (the
  picture already holds the sender's own contacts, published four times a
  second) to the addressed members in member order, each the bandit nearest
  itself that nobody has yet, then at most two on one bandit; known
  Winchester, bingo-or-worse and heavily damaged members are skipped; the
  sender's own target is left out. Pure geometry over plain rows, so the
  human's order and the AI lead's sort run the same code. `DataLink::sort_plan`
  builds the rows from the picture and `World::sort_order` carries the plan
  out (built, G3c).
- Disengage, Protect me, Attack on contact, Bug out and Land clear the
  addressed members' assignments; so do the target's or receiver's loss, a new
  target order and a change of lead.

Delivery is always by link: the AI gets the target, a human gets the cues. Every
assignment is also voiced. A blanket attack order that names no target is
called "Attack bandits" and makes no assignment (John, 2026-10-05, slice G3a).

**AI leads (built, G4).** The mission keeps a list of the AI leads that took
a new target this tick (a lead whose controller target changed to another
aircraft in the decision loop) and, after every actor has decided and the
automatic releases are delivered, runs `AiMission::lead_commits`
(`ai/mission_leads.rs`) for each. The lead must be alive, released, in free
flight and on loose control, and no human may lead its wing. Then, in this
order:

1. **A sort**, when the flight has not sorted for 30 seconds
   (`AiMission::sort_clock`, `SORT_INTERVAL_TICKS`) and the picture knows
   another bandit within the sort's reach: `tore_sim::datalink::sort` (the
   pure geometry the human's Alt+A uses) deals each fit wingman a different
   bandit, at most two to one, the lead's own target left out, from the
   bandits the side's pictures hold (`LinkInput::bandits`, built by
   `DataLink::known_bandits` and carried forward to the tick of the
   picture, as `sort_plan` has them) and the members' state as last published
   (`LinkInput::states`: Winchester, bingo or worse, heavily damaged).
2. **Otherwise a share**: the lead's target goes to the wingmen that have
   none and are fit, up to the two-attacker allowance with the lead counted
   among the attackers (`wing::share_targets`, connected at last), first by
   member number.

Both are loose-control rules: under medium or tight control the lead gives
nothing. A wingman takes the target as the controller takes any target order
(`TargetOrder::ConcreteTarget`) and keeps its own mission role, which differs
from a human's Engage order (that one also replaces the role with "destroy this
aircraft"): once its target is gone it chooses again as it did before, where an
order leaves a wingman idle until the next one (agent decision). Only AI
wingmen that fly the mission's free engagement and are released take a target
(`AiActor::accepts_shared`); escorts, patrols, intercepts, neutral wingmen and
any wingman landing, taking off, returning damaged or ejecting are left alone.
A human flying in the lead's wing is dealt too, from slice G11 (see
[below](#ai-leads-and-human-wingmen-built-g11)). Each target given
is a `MissionOutput::link` event, `Assign { lead, receiver, target, order }`
with the order `Sort` or `EngageMyTarget` (the share), written after the
wingman took it.

<a id="ai-leads-and-human-wingmen-built-g11"></a>
**AI leads and human wingmen (built, G11, John 2026-10-06).** The rules above
deal a target to a human flying in the AI lead's wing as to an AI wingman. The
world hands the mission, with the picture of each tick, one `HumanWingman` row
for each living human (`LinkInput::wingmen`, from `DataLink::human_wingmen`):
the aircraft the human is assigned, and whether it is idle. The mission joins
a row with its own `HumanMember` (side, wing, place) and the world snapshot
(alive, not on the ground, where it is), so the lead sorts and shares over AI
actors and humans in member order (`AiMission::lead_wingmen`). A human that is
taken in a sort or share becomes the same `Assign` event; the mission orders
nothing of it (it is no actor), and `DataLink::after_ai`, the call
(`World::voice_lead_assignments`, made for the receiver wherever it flies) and
the cues are as for an AI receiver. Agent decisions:

- **Idle.** A human is idle for a share when it holds no radar lock (the
  engagement table has no row for it) and no assignment younger than
  `FRESH_ASSIGNMENT_TICKS`, 30 seconds. An assignment the human never acted on
  therefore stops keeping it from a later share after 30 seconds, but it stays
  in the table until a clearing rule ends it. The AI wingman's own rule is its
  controller having no target; a human's lock is that.
- **Counting.** The human's lock is a row in the engagement table (G2), so the
  share counts it among the attackers of the lead's bandit, and the sort's "at
  most two on one" counts the human among the wingmen it deals. A human that
  already holds or has locked the bandit a sort would deal it is dealt it
  again by the rule but gets no new assignment and no call.
- **Fit.** The sort's and share's skipped states are the picture's, as for AI
  wingmen. A human on the ground, down, or with no row in the picture's
  input is not dealt anything.
- **The call.** The AI lead's call keeps its G4 delivery: every living human of
  the lead's flight hears it, worded from the receiver's place, with the lead's
  3.5 second spacing, so the human receiver hears "Two, attack bandit ..." on
  its own channel, as the humans of the flight hear every call to an AI
  wingman. The F2-R order call (which only the addressed human hears) is a
  human lead's own voice and is not used here.
- **Yield.** Unchanged: AI members only, a human is never moved.
- **Single player.** The player leads its wing, so no AI lead has a human
  wingman there and every probe is SAME.

**What the world does with them.** `DataLink::after_ai` reads the events,
records each as an assignment (so the picture holds it, the pursuit flies
a wingman that cannot see the target toward its track as in G3b, the cues
show it and the sort warning counts it as the lead's) and returns them;
`World::voice_lead_assignments` (`world/datalink_leads.rs`) makes the
assignment call in the lead's label ("Two, attack bandit, bearing 270, 15
miles, angels 20", from where the wingman flies), important, to the seats of
the lead's flight that are alive, a lead's calls of one tick 3.5 seconds apart.
A call nobody hears is journaled as unheard like every other call of an AI
flight (the cause is the lead's new target). The call does not go through
`radio_calls::say`, but it asks `radio_calls::battle_hearers` (G8) for the
seats of the side's other flights that monitor the battle net, which hear it
with the flight colour in front and `Net` before the speaker (agent decision:
the voicing stays in `world/datalink_leads.rs`, out of the radio files).

**The yield.** `DataLink::sort_edge` (`datalink/warning.rs`) returns, with the
sort warnings of a tick, the AI member of each new unmeant pair of locks that
leaves the aircraft alone: never a human, the higher member number when both
are AI, and never one that holds an assignment on the aircraft. The world hands
it to `AiMission::yield_target`, which gives the actor a yield (the aircraft
and the tick it ends, ten seconds on, `YIELD_TICKS`). While it lasts, the actor's
engagement policy chooses from the aircraft it sees without the yielded one,
if any other is eligible, and from all of them if not (a wingman keeps the
only bandit it has); the actor keeps whichever it took when the yield ends.
The first tick a yield is in force it writes a `Yield { actor, target }`
event. Yields and each flight's last sort are mission state, coded in the
mission's checkpoint (`mission_checkpoint.rs`).

### Calls and nets

`datalink/calls.rs` words the assignment call as a `comms::Phrase`: the
addressee (`comms::number` of its position, or the flight colour stem for the
whole flight), `^ATTACK`, `^BANDIT`, `^BEARING` with the bearing as three
digits one by one (John, 2026-10-05), `comms::miles`, `^ANGELS` with the height. It is
sent with `Comms::send` and one `Hearer` per listener; for a whole-flight call
each hearer's words are its own geometry, as `Hearer::saying` gives a contact
report's. The kind is important (radio silence never drops an order). A
human sender's call replaces the `^ATTACK` order voice and keeps its channel
hold and cut-off; an AI lead's call goes through the channel like wing chatter.
A sort's calls are queued 3.5 seconds apart with `Call::after`.

**Nets** (G8, built). `Call` gains `net: Net` (`Wing`, `Battle`); every call is
`Wing` unless a hearer says otherwise (`Hearer::on(Net::Battle)`). Each seat's
`Channel` gains `battle: bool`, toggled by `SeatCommand::BattleNet` (Alt+N),
off at start and kept across a restart as radio silence is
(`Comms::{monitors_battle, toggle_battle}`). When a flight's lead makes a
contact report or an assignment call, the call also gets a hearer for every
living seat of the same side, outside that flight, that monitors the battle
net, with the speaker's flight colour put in front of its words and its label
(`Net Blue one`). The journal's `heard_by` lists them; a call no monitoring
seat hears is journaled exactly as today (`OtherFlight`), so recordings
without a monitoring seat are unchanged. The Network link itself needs no
call: every living aircraft of the side sees the published pictures of the side's other flights.

`radio_calls::battle_hearers` is the one rule: the speaker must lead its
flight, and a listener hears it when it is alive, on the speaker's side, in
another flight and monitoring. It takes the words as a function of the
listener, so a contact report is each monitor's own (its clock position, range
and height from its own aircraft, as a flight mate's is) and an assignment
call is the lead's, measured from the wingman it names. `battle_words` puts the
flight colour first ("Blue, Contact, bandit, your two o'clock high, 12 miles"),
unless the call already begins with it (an attack call to the whole flight).
`Radio::chatter` repeats a lead's `Chatter::Contact` this way; `World::battle_net_call`
(`world/commands.rs`) repeats a human lead's Engage my target, Engage from
formation and every call of a sort, with the lead's own timing (the first at
once, a sort's later ones 3.5 seconds apart). An AI lead's assignment calls are
slice G4's: its call goes through the channel like wing chatter, and G4 builds
its hearers with the same function. Radio silence drops the net's contact
reports as it drops wing chatter; the assignment calls are important and come
through. The `Net` prefix is `Net::prefix` ("Net "), part of the hearer's label
so the HUD line reads `Net Blue one: 'Blue, Contact, ...'`.

### Cues and the readout

`CockpitReadout` gains `link: LinkReadout`, filled by `World::cockpit_readout`
(and by the lazy readout of `World::flight_frame`) from `DataLink::readout(plane)`
after `readout::build` (so `Combat` is not touched). Built in slice G6; the
build changed the design's shape in two ways, both agent decisions: locks and
assignments ride in their own `marks` list instead of on the tracks, so a lock
shows the tick it is taken and not at the next publishing tick, and there is no
`sort` field, because the warning is an edge that is already a HUD line and a
beep, and nothing draws a held cue.

| Field | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `radar` | The plane's aircraft has a radar, so a radar scope to mark. It gates the scope's marks only (below) |
| `assigned` | The plane's assignment by link: target, assigner, acknowledged |
| `tracks` | Up to 24 rows, nearest first: target id, position, velocity, source (own, flight, network) |
| `marks` | One row for each target a flightmate has locked or been assigned, in target order, at most 32: lockers (a mask of the flightmates' member numbers), locked over the battle net (the flight and member of the lowest plane id of another flight), assigned to (a mask; every flightmate's assignment but the plane's own) |
| `mates` | Flightmates: plane, member, fuel, weapons, damage |

**No radar, no scope marks (John, 2026-10-05).** A plane whose aircraft has
no radar still receives the whole `link`, and its AI reads the picture as any
other. Its player keeps the target window's tag and state, the HUD's brackets
and the sort warning: "keep target window and hud cues, just we can't see the
radar." Only the scope's marks and remote tracks go, because the aircraft has
no scope: `scope::scope` asks `LinkReadout::on_scope()` (the radar flag)
first. (The first build gated every cue on the flag, an agent decision from
John's earlier words; he narrowed it.)

**The displays** (all in `tore-app`, none touches the simulation):

- `scope::scope` turns the marks into `LinkMarks` on the contacts it draws
  (numbers of the flightmates that locked it and were assigned it, and the
  player's own assignment, acknowledged once the sensors hold the lock, a tick
  before the picture does) and the tracks no radar contact of the plane's holds
  into `RemoteTrack`s. `instruments` draws the numbers beside the square, the
  diamond that blinks once a second until the lock, and a hollow peach square
  for a remote track (never selectable).
- `target_window::link_tag` and `mate_state` (in `tore-world`, pure text) give
  the tag and the flightmate's state lines; `instruments` draws them under the
  activity line.
- `weapon_hud` draws four corner brackets round the assigned target while the
  plane has not locked it and the blink is lit, only where the target is
  inside the HUD's view.

**The sort warning** is `DataLink::sort_warnings` (`datalink/warning.rs`), run
once a tick after the AI step. A pair is two living members of one flight
holding a lock on one aircraft. The pair fires once when it forms and again
only after it has broken and re-formed; the table `warned` holds the pairs that
are formed and have fired. A pair the lead meant is never fired: both members
assigned the aircraft, or one assigned it by the other (agent decision). Each
human of the pair gets a `Cue::Message` ("Sort:
Red two is locked on your target.") and a direct `^BEEP2` `Cue::Radio`, unless
its seat was warned in the last ten seconds (`seat_warned`). The pair is
recorded all the same when the seat is held back, because the AI's yield (G4)
reads the pair, not the seat. The cues are ordinary message and radio cues, so
a client receives them as today's message and radio events do.
What each cue looks like is in the [guide](DATALINK.md#what-the-player-sees).

### On the wire

Summary; the bytes are in the [protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#data-link-stage-g)
(built, slice G7, protocol 15): four readout parts (the seat's Link scalars
right after the header, so an assignment never waits for room; the marks,
mates and tracks lists after the contacts, in that order; slice G6 settled
the marks list, see [above](#cues-and-the-readout)), one event (`Link`: a
member joined, an assignment given, cleared or acknowledged, a lock taken or
dropped, a sort warning, for members of the seat's flight), the `Sort` order
and `BattleNet` command in the inputs, and the net on radio events. The host
fills the seat's readout from `DataLink::readout` as `World::cockpit_readout`
does, and drains the data link's journal with the score facts
(`tore_session::journal::drain`). Locks and assignments therefore reach a
client in the next snapshot and are repeated until acknowledged, which is
John's "sent immediately as reliable events". The tracks change only on
publishing ticks and are sent as plain differences, so between them the
readout's delta coding sends nothing for them. Measured on the 15 against 15
mission: 9 bytes a snapshot on average, at most 146 in a snapshot after the
first and 1.8 KB in a second, about 280 bytes a second in all.

### Replays

`DataLink`'s journal holds `member` (each plane's radar flag, at the start),
`assign` (receiver, target, assigner, order, and the call's words),
`clear` (and why), `acknowledge`, `lock`, `unlock` and `sort_warning`. Like
the communication journal it is write-only, bounded at 1,024 entries between
drains, and draws no random number. The recorder drains it every tick, after
the communication journal, into `datalink.*` events (`tore_replay::vocab`),
new kinds within the format's version
([versions](REPLAYS.md#versions-and-damage), [the events](REPLAYS.md#data-link-events)).
The assignment calls stay in the communication journal's entry for the order
(slice G3a settled this; a separate `comms.radio` entry with a trigger of its
own was the first design). A client's capture conversion (stage E) makes the
same events from the `Link` events it received (slice G7).

### State for exact checkpoints

Stage H must carry the state stage G adds. Named here so the checkpoint design
can list it. Slice H10 coded `DataLink` whole (`datalink_checkpoint.rs`); every
G slice that adds a field to it codes the field there in its own slice, and the
`DataLink` coder will not compile until it does. The other rows below are coded
by the slice that adds them, in the coder beside the owner:

| Owner | State |
| --- | --- |
| `tore_world::datalink::DataLink` | `members` (with `alive`), `pictures` (each flight's publish tick, tracks and member status), `locks`, `engaged`, `assignments` (by receiver: target, giver, tick, the `PlayerOrder` and `acknowledged`), `warned`, `seat_warned`. The journal is write-only and local, like the communication journal: whatever H decides for that one applies |
| `tore_world::comms` | Each seat's `Channel::battle`; `Call::net` on every queued call |
| `tore_sim::ai::AiMission` | `sort_clock` (each flight's last sort tick; built and coded, G4); the link input set at the start of the step (rebuilt by `before_ai` each tick, so H may rebuild it rather than code it) |
| `tore_sim::ai` actor and controller | The track pursuit flag (built, G3b: `TargetView::link_track`, coded with the view; the pursuit itself is per-step scratch like the rest of `LinkInput`); each actor's yield list (target, until tick, announced; built and coded in the actor's coder, G4) |
| Not state | The radar table (from the aircraft type); the engagement table (rebuilt from the controllers at the start of each decision loop, with the humans' locks from `AiMission::set_link`, which the step consumes: slice G2 skips it in the coder); the per-seat views and the readout |

No new random stream exists, so H has none to add.

### Single-player changes

Each change is its own slice with a single-player baseline comparison
(`.local/mp-baseline`) against the merge before it, every difference
explained in the slice's report. John approves the listed differences before
the merge.

| Slice | Change | Differences expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0, G1, G3c, G7, G8 | None | SAME (G3c's key and G8's monitor change nothing until used) |
| G2 | The AI counts a human's locked target | AI wingmen of the player's flight rank the player's locked bandit 10,000 ft lower (and 20,000 ft at the allowance): different targets and everything after, only in probes where the player locks |
| G3a | The order voice says the assignment call | The order's journal entry and recording stems for Engage my target and Engage from formation; no motion changes |
| G3b | Wingmen take assignments by link | Probes with those orders: wingmen no longer refuse a target only a flightmate's track holds |
| G4 | AI leads share and sort; AI yield | Every probe with an AI-led wing under loose control or AI wingmen: targets, launches and kills move; the radio journal gains AI assignment calls (heard only by the flight). The slice report, `.local/mp-notes/m2r/g4-baseline.md`, lists the probes that moved and why |
| G6 | Cues drawn | No recording changes; GPU captures change only where a flightmate locks or an assignment exists |
| G9 | `datalink.*` events recorded | Recordings gain the new events and nothing else |

### Testing

Targeted per slice (the table below), each test added to the suite; the AI
lane's `--probe-wing-order` grows a `sort` order and a recipient
(`TICK:ORDER@MEMBER`), the probe a `--probe-player-lock TICK:ID` step, and the
probe prints a `data link:` line for every assignment, warning and yield so
scenarios can assert on them. New files get `tools/battery_selection.py`
rules in the slice that creates them. The full run at the end of the
milestone covers: the AI lane (its data link scenarios and every scenario the
single-player changes move), the `net` lane's data link scenario, the
render lane's link-cue captures, and the long ignored tests G7 adds.

### How stage G lands

Slices on `mp/g-<topic>` branches, each with the quick check per change, the
check list at the end and the single-player baseline when the table says so.
"Opus" slices are a determinism refactor or the wire, as John asked; the rest
are Sonnet.

| Slice | Model | After | Files it owns | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G0 Radar table and picture | Sonnet | | `tore-sim/src/datalink.rs` (and its `lib.rs` line), `tore-world/src/datalink.rs`, `datalink/{picture,view,ai_input,journal}.rs` and tests, `world.rs` (field, `before_ai`, `after_ai`), read-only accessors in `ai_wings.rs`, the AI probe's options in `tore-app` (`--probe-player-lock`, the `@MEMBER` recipient, the `data link:` line), `tools/battery_selection.py` | The radar table; members, locks, engagements, publishing; `view` and `ai_input` skeletons; the journal; the probe options; nothing consumes the picture. **Built (G0, 2026-10-05):** `tore_sim::datalink` (`has_radar`) and `tore_world::datalink` (`DataLink`, `Member`, `Scene`, `Journal`, `LinkView`, `AiInput`), with `World::datalink` read after combat's events (`before_ai`) and after the AI step (`after_ai`) and reset by a restart. Nothing consumes the picture, so the AI decides exactly as before. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The members are rebuilt from the roster every tick, the aircraft type being the ownship's or the actor's, and a plane that is dead holds no lock and no engagement. Every living member reports tracks and member state, the radar-less included. Built first with Voice, Flight and Network tiers and reworked on John's decision of 2026-10-05 to the radar flag. A human's fuel reports Normal, Fumes or Out, because joker and bingo are judged against the home point the crew voice keeps; the AI's reports all five levels from its controller. Locks use the weapon phase test of `locks_on` until G1 adds `lock_of`. The assignment, warned and seat-warned tables exist and are empty, so G3a, G3b and G6 fill them without editing `datalink.rs`. The probe gains `--probe-player-lock TICK:ID` (a designation, so the lock follows when the sensors hold it), `TICK:ORDER@MEMBER` (member 1 is the first wingman) and `--probe-data-link`, and prints `t=T data link: member`, `lock` and `unlock` lines only when asked, so every other probe's output is unchanged. AI scenario `ai-datalink-picture` (family `ai-datalink`). Single player: SAME, see the baseline in the slice report. | Every `AircraftId::SELECTABLE` has an entry, F-22N and F/A-XX resolve to the F-22A; a radar-less member is linked all the same; tracks change only on ticks divisible by 30; locks and engagements match the ownships and controllers on the crowd fixture; two runs equal; baseline SAME |
| G1 Engagement table | Opus | G0 | `tore-sim/src/ai/link.rs` (new, and its `mod` line), `ai/mission.rs`, `ai/controller.rs`, `ai_wings.rs` | The decision-order engagement table; `wing_attackers` and `leader_view` read it; `lock_of` shared by `locks_on`, `aiming_at` and the picture. **Built (G1, 2026-10-05):** `tore_sim::ai::link` holds `Engagements` (one row per actor in actor order: id, side, wing, target), `engagement_of` (a living actor's controller target) and `lock_of` (that, while the weapon service tracks or fires). `AiMission::step_using` builds the table before its decision loop and rewrites an actor's row right after `step_actor` returns, early returns included; `step_actor` and `leader_view` take it as an argument, so no AI type gains a field and the checkpoint coders are untouched. `locks_on` and the picture's `ai_target` call `lock_of`; `aiming_at` calls `engagement_of`, because the music asks for a ready store, not a lock (agent decision). The decision loop runs on the calling thread and workers still only prepare observations, so the same-tick visibility holds with workers on. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The "test-only copy of the old scan" is `link::audit`: a thread-local switch, off unless a test starts it, that compares the table with the old scans (the wing attacker list and the leader's target) at every actor's turn; off, it costs one thread-local read per actor step. It runs on the 30-actor (15 against 15) mission fixture of the observation tests with its scripted damage, crashes, landing orders and human handoff, a shuffled pool against the serial reference with complete state compared each tick (`ai/link_tests.rs`; every executor and both seeds for ten simulated seconds is ignored, about four minutes, for the full suite), and in `tore-world` on the crowd fight with both leaders ordering their AI in, the AI fight with a plane handed back and an enemy taken mid-fight while two enemies crash, and the open mission with handoffs (`world/engagement_tests.rs`). A mutation that skips the row rewrite fails at the first tick. Single player: SAME, see the baseline in the slice report. | A test-only copy of the old scan equals the table for every actor of every tick over seeded fights (crowd, 15 against 15, with handoffs and deaths); baseline SAME |
| G3a Assignments and calls | Sonnet | G0 | `datalink/{assign,calls}.rs`, `world/commands.rs`, `ai_wings/orders.rs` | `DataLink::assign`, its clearing rules, the call's words and hearers, the human order voice replaced; a blanket attack order that names no target says "Attack bandits" (John, 2026-10-05); delivery to AI still `ConcreteTarget` | Words and stems for bearings 5, 90, 270, ranges 0.5, 1, 15, 20, 30 and heights 0 and 20,000 ft; per-hearer geometry; the call is important and keeps the channel hold; clearing on each rule; baseline differs only in order calls (explained) **Built (G3a, 2026-10-05):** `datalink/assign.rs` (`DataLink::assign`, `ClearReason`, `assignment`, and `settle`, which ends finished assignments and marks locked ones at the end of `after_ai`), `datalink/calls.rs` (`Geometry`, `Addressee`, `assignment_phrase`, `blanket_phrase`, `assignment_call`, `hearers`, `Listener`, the stems), `AiWings::command_called` (`command_at` plus the radio flight number; `OrderReport` gains `reached` and `target`), and `World::wing_order` calling `assign` for every order that reached someone. The build settled these, each an agent decision. `assign(tick, sender, order, receivers, target)` takes the planes the order reached, which are the AI wingmen that took it (a wingman that refuses for "cannot see the target" gets no assignment until G3b) and the human wingmen it addressed, who get the cues. Engage my target and Engage from formation write an assignment each (replacing any); Disengage, Protect me, Attack on contact, Bug out, Land and an Approach (which sets a target of its own) clear the assignments of the planes they reached; formation, break, spacing, stacking and control orders leave the table alone. The rest of the clearing rules run every tick: the receiver or the target is dead, or the giver is dead or the mission names another leader of the flight. A target that lands does not end an assignment yet (the AI exposes no landed state for it). A member that holds a lock on its assigned target marks it acknowledged, once. The journal gains `Assign`, `Clear` (with the reason) and `Acknowledge`; the call's words stay in the communication journal's entry for the order, because the datalink entry is `Copy` and G9 can read both. The call: "Two, attack bandit, bearing 270, 15 miles, angels 20", worded with its own text and the original's recordings (`^NUMnn` and the falling `^NUMnnD`, `^MILEnn`, `^BEARING`, `^ANGELS`, `^ATTACK`, `^BANDIT` and the colour stems). The bearing is true, in whole degrees from 1 to 360, said as real-world brevity has it (John, 2026-10-05): always three digits one by one, each its own recording with `^NUM00` for a zero, so 016 is "zero one six", 005 "zero zero five" and north "three six zero"; the range is the distance over the ground, in whole nautical miles, left out under one mile (the contact report measures in a straight line and rounds first); the height is the target's own in thousands of feet to the nearest, never below zero; the last digit of the bearing and the last number of the height fall in pitch, as in the waypoint call. A wingman is addressed by its place ("Two" is member 1) and the whole flight by the colour of its radio flight number (orange, purple and yellow have words only). The human lead hears the call as the first addressed wingman would, which is the wingman that replies; the same call goes in the order's journal entry and the `Cue::OrderVoice` stems, which are `&'static str`, so `calls::intern` hands out the fixed table of stems a call can use. Engage from formation, silent before, now says the call. Attack on contact says "Attack bandits" (`^ATTACK`, `^BANDITS`), makes no assignment and clears. `calls::hearers` builds one `Hearer` for each listening seat with its own geometry, and `assignment_call` makes the call important so radio silence never drops it and, delivered, it holds the channel; a human wingman's seat hears it through slice F2-R's order call to human wingmen (`World::call_human_wingmen`, which extends this one). Single player: the full baseline differs only by the order calls, see the slice report. Tests: `datalink/calls.rs` (the words and stems for bearings 5, 90, 270 and north, ranges 0.5, 1, 15, 20 and 30, heights 0 and 20,000 ft, per-hearer geometry, the important call and the channel hold through `Comms`, every stem a call can make is in the table), `datalink/assign.rs` (each order, each clearing rule, the acknowledgement), `world/datalink_assign_tests.rs` (on the crowd fixture: the call and the assignments of a whole-flight order and of one wingman, the three clearing orders, a destroyed target, the acknowledgement, two equal runs), the four order tests in `ai_wings` that named `^ATTACK`, and AI scenario `ai-datalink-assign`. |
| G6 Cues | Sonnet | G0 | `readout.rs`, `frame.rs`, `target_window.rs`, `datalink/{view,warning}.rs`, `tore-app` `scope.rs`, `instruments.rs`, `weapon_hud.rs`, `combat_view.rs`, `main.rs` (the HUD's assigned target), `flight_ui.rs` if needed, the `replay_target` call sites | `LinkReadout`; the sort warning; radar markers, target window tags and mate line, HUD brackets | Unit tests for each marker, the tag's priority, the brackets' blink and their end on lock, the warning's edge and cooldown; a headless capture of a linked scene, and of one with a radar-less aircraft that shows no cue on the missing display; single-player recordings SAME **Built (G6, 2026-10-05):** `LinkReadout` and `DataLink::readout` as [described above](#cues-and-the-readout); the radar's lock and assignment numbers, diamond and peach remote squares, the target window's tag and flightmate state, the HUD's brackets, and the sort warning (`datalink/warning.rs`). Unit tests for each marker (`scope::tests`, `instruments::link_cue_tests`), the tag's priority and the state lines (`target_window::tests`), the brackets' blink, their end on lock and their shape (`weapon_hud::tests`), the readout's marks and assignment (`datalink::view::tests`, `world::datalink_cues_tests`), and the warning's edge, cooldown, suppression and seats (`datalink::warning::tests`, `world::datalink_cues_tests`); `a_linked_scene_draws_its_cues_and_one_with_no_radar_has_none_on_its_scope` renders the radar and target-window pages of a linked scene and of one with a radar-less aircraft headless and checks that the radar-less radar page is the unlinked picture, byte for byte, and its target window still carries the tag. Two windowed replay-lane scenarios fly a flight of three: `replay-script-link-cues` (attack on contact, the wingmen lock the player's bandit, the warning reads) and `replay-script-link-assign` (Engage my target assigns both wingmen, no warning). The build settled these, each an agent decision. The radar flag gates only the scope's marks (John, 2026-10-05; the build first gated every cue). Locks and assignments ride in a `marks` list, and there is no `sort` field. The blink is once a second (the receiver's), where the guide said "as the HUD's radar-ready diamond", which blinks twice. A pair the lead meant is not warned of. The wire files only gained a defaulted `link` field, so G7 owns its coding. Single-player recordings SAME (no recording stores a cue); the baseline report is `.local/mp-notes/m2r/g6-baseline.md` |
| G2 Humans in the table | Sonnet | G1 | `ai/mission.rs`, `ai/link.rs`, `datalink/ai_input.rs`, `ai_wings.rs` (`set_link`) | Human locked targets enter the engagement table; `AiWings::set_link` | A wingman ranks the player's locked bandit with the penalty; AI scenario `ai-datalink-player-lock`; baseline differences explained **Built (G2, 2026-10-05):** `tore_sim::ai::link` gains `LinkInput` (the humans' locked targets, `HumanEngagement { plane, target }`) and `Engagements::with_humans`, which appends one row per human lock after the actors' rows, in the human's own side and wing (`HumanMember`). `AiMission::set_link` hands the input over and `step_using` takes it at the start of the decision loop, so the human rows hold the value `before_ai` read after combat for the whole step (humans do not decide in the loop) and `wing_targets` lists the actors' targets in decision order and then the humans' locks. `AiWings::set_link(&DataLink)` reads the new `DataLink::human_engagements` (`AiInput::human_engagements` is the same list) and `World::step_with` calls it right before the AI step, so the AI sees the lock the sensors hold this tick. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The input is per-step scratch, not state: the step consumes it and a step without it sees no human lock, so `AiMission` codes nothing for it (`skip` in `mission_checkpoint.rs`, as the missile snapshots are) and the whole-world equivalence needed no change; `DataLink` gained no field. A lock from a plane the mission holds no `HumanMember` for counts for nobody, and a plane the mission also flies as an actor keeps its actor row, so a handoff never counts a plane twice. A human counts for the wing it flies in and for no other: the enemy wing, another friendly wing and the human's own wing's other humans are untouched (humans read nothing). Only the radar lock counts, as the picture holds it (`Ownship::sensors.acquired()`): a designation the sensors have not yet locked is no engagement. The penalty is B41's own (+10,000 ft for one attacker, +20,000 ft at the allowance of two), and a wingman already inside 20,000 ft of its current target keeps it (retention), so the change shows when a wingman chooses a target after the player's lock, not when it already has one. The G1 audit covers the humans' rows (`Report::human_attacking`): the table must equal the old actor scan followed by the humans' locks at every actor's turn. Single player: DIFFERENT only where the player locks a target a wingman has yet to choose, see the slice report. Tests: `ai/link_tests.rs` (the humans' rows by wing, a wingman choosing the other bandit with the player's lock and the nearer one without, the input consumed by the step, the 15 against 15 audit with a human lock in it), `world/engagement_tests.rs` (`humans_locks_are_read_by_their_wings_ai`: on the crowd fixture the actors that saw a lock are exactly the human's wing's, every tick), and AI scenarios `ai-datalink-player-lock` and `ai-datalink-player-lock-mirror` (the player locks one of two bandits 20 nm out and its wingman, ordered in later, takes the other, in both directions). |
| G3b Assignments reach the AI | Sonnet | G2, G3a | `ai/controller.rs`, `ai/wing.rs`, `ai/link.rs`, `ai/mission.rs`, `ai_wings/orders.rs`, `datalink/assign.rs` | Track pursuit; the refusal replaced. `TargetOrder::Heard` and "Tally Ho" are **dropped** (John, 2026-10-05: no Voice tier) | A wingman pursues a target only a flightmate tracks and fires only on its own lock; AI scenario `ai-datalink-order-link` (F/A-18D); `ai-datalink-order-voice` is dropped; baseline differences explained **Built (G3b, 2026-10-05):** `LinkInput::pursuits` (`ai/link.rs`: `Pursuit`, with `Pursuit::view`), `TargetView::link_track` (coded with the view), `Controller::ordered_target`, `DataLink::{track_on, tracked, pursuits}` (`datalink/assign.rs`), `AiWings::command_linked` (`command_called` delegates with no picture, so its callers are unchanged) and `AiWings::set_link` handing the pursuits over. `World::wing_order` asks the picture whether it holds a track of the order's target. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The link covers the two Engage orders only: Approach flies on its own target's observation and keeps the refusal, and an Engage order that neither the wingman's sensors nor the picture covers still answers "cannot see the target". The picture's tracks are published four times a second, so an order in the first quarter second of a contact is refused as before. The track is the freshest one any flight of the receiver's side reports (the later observation wins, a tie keeps the first flight), carried forward to the tick at its own velocity, with the aircraft's type from the world object, so it is the same view whoever reported it. A wingman flies by a link view only while its controller's ordered target is the assignment's target and it is not neutral or returning damaged. The view is added to `targets` after the attack evidence is read and before the engagement policy chooses, so a mission role (escort, patrol) still decides whether the assigned aircraft is a legal choice, and retention keeps the order's target while the view lasts; `station_views`, the station aim and `wing_combat` read the observed targets only. `Controller::step` passes the weapons no target for a link view, so the weapon service never leaves its search state, no store is chosen, no gun solution is made and `lock_of` is `None`: it fires only on a target its own sensors hold, and when they take the aircraft over the same target, no longer flagged, goes through the weapons as any other. The designation of the sensors is left alone (it fails for an aircraft the sensors do not hold). When no flightmate reports the aircraft any more the view goes and the wingman chooses a target as it would without the order. No `DataLink` field was added, so its checkpoint coder is unchanged. The probe gains `--probe-blind-wing` (`AiActor::blind`, `AiWings::blind_wingmen`: no radar, infrared sensor or eyes for the player's wingmen; the skill-based visual lookout of `awareness` is not a sensor profile and still sees within a few miles), the harness the scenario and the world test need, because the player and its wingmen fly one aircraft type and so hold the same sensors. Single player: the planned change appears only where a wingman cannot see an Engage target a flightmate tracks, or loses sight of it while a flightmate still tracks it, and the full baseline has no such probe: every item is SAME, see the slice report. Tests: `ai/link_tests.rs` (the view's position carried forward, heading, pitch, speed and flag, the refusals; a blind wingman flying a track for 25 s and never locking or firing, also with the bandit in perfect firing position; no track, no order, and its own radar taking the target over and firing), `datalink/assign.rs` (the freshest track, the sides, the tracked test, the pursuits), `ai_wings/orders.rs` (acceptance with a track for both Engage orders, the refusals that stay), `world/datalink_assign_tests.rs` (a blind AI flight takes the lead's Engage order at 60 nm, is given the pursuit, keeps the target and never locks), and AI scenario `ai-datalink-order-link`. |
| G3c Sort order | Sonnet | G3b | `tore-sim/src/datalink/sort.rs`, `ai/wing.rs` (`PlayerOrder::Sort`), `datalink/assign.rs`, `input_catalog.rs`, `docs/CONTROLS.md`, `docs/tore-keyboard-map.html`, the probe's order names, `tools/battery_scenarios/ai.py` | Alt+A; the sort; calls 3.5 s apart | Sort tests (distinct, nearest, two at most, skipped members); the controls test; AI scenario `order-sort-wing4`; baseline SAME **Built (G3c, 2026-10-05):** `tore_sim::datalink::sort` (`sort`, `Bandit`, `Wingman`, `Sorted`, `SORT_REACH_FT`, `MAX_ON_BANDIT`: the rule over plain rows), `PlayerOrder::Sort`, `DataLink::{side_tracks, sort_plan}` with `SortPick` and `SortPlan` (`datalink/assign.rs`), `World::sort_order` (`world/commands_sort.rs`), Alt+A (`input_catalog.rs`, `flight_ui.rs`, `docs/CONTROLS.md`, the Comms sheet of the keyboard map) and the probe's `--probe-wing-order TICK:sort`. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The sort is carried out as one Engage my target for each wingman, sent to that wingman alone with its bandit (so each takes it as it takes Engage: the same checks, the first wingman's reply, one comms journal line each), and then `DataLink::assign` is called with the order `Sort`, so the assignment says it was a sort. `PlayerOrder::Sort` handed to `AiWings::command_linked` itself is an error, because a sort needs the picture. The bandits are the whole side's tracks, the freshest report of each, carried forward at their velocity to the tick of the sort, without any the picture knows to be dead; the lead's own contacts are in them because its flight publishes them. The range is a straight line, the lower aircraft id wins a tie, and the wingmen's state is as last published (a wingman not yet published is fit). The first AI wingman's call is the order voice, played at once; each later one (AI wingmen only; a human wingman's call is slice F2-R's, heard at once on its own channel) is a radio call in the lead's label, queued with `Call::after` at 3.5 seconds a call, important, with the cause Engage my target to that wingman. With nothing to deal the order is refused with a HUD line and a journal entry. The wire codes the order as 13 (the protocol document already planned it; slice G7 owns the version bump), as do the seat and data link checkpoint coders. Also touched, because the new variant forced it: `ai_wings/orders.rs` (`leads_wing` is public, the order's labels), `tore-session/src/wire/inputs.rs`, `seats_checkpoint.rs`, `datalink_checkpoint.rs` and `world/commands.rs` (one dispatch line and a `mod`). Single player: SAME, the key does nothing until pressed. Tests: `datalink/sort.rs` (distinct, nearest, member order, the lead's target, two at most, skipped members, the 40 nm reach, ties), `datalink/assign.rs` (the plan from the picture, carried tracks, the assignment's order), `world/datalink_sort_tests.rs` (the crowd fixture: the deal, the two calls 3.5 seconds apart, one wingman addressed, a wingman's refusal, nothing known, repeatability), the order's wire, seat and data link checkpoint round trips, `flight_ui` (Alt+A), the controls test and AI scenario `ai-order-sort-wing4`. |
| G4 AI leads | Sonnet | G3c | `ai/mission.rs`, `ai/link.rs`, `ai/controller.rs`, `ai_wings.rs`, `datalink/assign.rs` | Share, sort, yield, member state for AI leads; `MissionOutput::link` | Share caps at two under loose control and not under medium; a lead sorts once in 30 s; yield by member number, never a human; AI scenario `ai-datalink-lead-sort`; baseline differences explained **Built (G4, 2026-10-05):** `ai/mission_leads.rs` (new: `AiMission::lead_commits`, `yield_target`, `last_sort`, `AiActor::accepts_shared` and `yields`), `ai/link.rs` (`LinkInput::{bandits, states}` with `SideBandits` and `MemberState`, `LinkEvent::{Assign, Yield}`, `Yield`, `SortStamp`, `YIELD_TICKS`, `SORT_INTERVAL_TICKS`), `MissionOutput::link`, the yield filter in `AiMission::step_actor`, `DataLink::{known_bandits, lead_input, sort_edge}` and `LeadAssignment`, `DataLink::after_ai` (now returns the AI leads' assignments), `AiWings::{set_link, yield_target}`, `World::{voice_lead_assignments, apply_yields}` (`world/datalink_leads.rs`, new) and the mission coder (`yields`, `sort_clock`). The build settled these, each an agent decision. A lead acts when its controller target changes to another aircraft in the decision loop, and it sorts before it shares (see [above](#assignments)). The share counts the lead as one of the two attackers, so it gives one wingman the target; it goes to wingmen with no target of their own, so a wingman that already chose a bandit keeps it, while a sort deals every fit wingman. A wingman takes a shared or sorted target as a controller target order and keeps its mission role (a human's Engage order replaces it), and only released AI wingmen with the free engagement role take one. Under medium or tight control a lead neither shares nor sorts. A sort that deals nobody anything (no other bandit in reach, or every wingman skipped) leaves the clock alone and falls through to the share. The member state is the picture's, as last published (a member not yet published is fit). The yield: the AI member of a new unmeant pair, never a human, the higher member number of two AI, never one holding an assignment on the aircraft; it lasts ten seconds, leaves the aircraft out of the actor's choice while another is eligible, and the actor then keeps what it took. The AI lead's call is the assignment call of a human lead, made by `voice_lead_assignments` straight to `Comms`, heard by the live seats of the lead's flight and by the battle net's monitors through `radio_calls::battle_hearers`, and otherwise journaled unheard. The probe prints the assignments (`data link: assign`, already) but no yield line: a yield is not a journal entry, to keep the journal's variants as G9 has them. Single player: a planned change. The full baseline against `m2r-g6-final` has 284 items SAME and 32 DIFFERENT: 15 text outputs and 16 recordings of the probes with AI-led wings (fights, the attack probes, the ground landing probe, quick), each moving from the first sort, share or yield of an AI lead on, and one timing item that is machine load (rerun alone +2.5 percent); the report is `.local/mp-notes/m2r/g4-baseline.md`. Tests: `ai/mission_leads_tests.rs` (share to two, not under medium, an idle wingman only, a sort, the 30-second clock, a second commit shares, the skipped states, other roles and neutral wingmen, a human-led wing, yields: another bandit, kept when alone, never a human), `mission_checkpoint_tests.rs` (the clock and yields round trip), `datalink/warning.rs` (the yield's pair rules), `datalink/assign.rs` (the lead's input), `world/datalink_leads_tests.rs` (the enemy lead shares, sorts again, the call unheard, the same every run, the call heard by two seats 3.5 seconds apart, a yield reaches an AI member only) and AI scenario `ai-datalink-lead-sort`. |
| G8 Nets | Sonnet | G3c | `comms.rs`, `comms/journal.rs`, `radio_calls.rs`, `world/commands.rs`, `input_catalog.rs`, `docs/CONTROLS.md`, `docs/tore-keyboard-map.html` | `Net`, `Channel::battle`, Alt+N, battle-net hearers with the colour | Only monitoring seats of the side outside the flight hear it, with the colour; the journal unchanged without them; the controls test; baseline SAME **Built (G8, 2026-10-05):** `comms::Net` (`Wing`, `Battle`, and `Net::prefix`), `Call::net`, `Hearer::on`, `Entry::net` (`comms/journal.rs`), `Channel::battle` with `Comms::{monitors_battle, toggle_battle}`, `radio_calls::{battle_hearers, battle_words, battle_label}`, `World::battle_net_call` (`world/commands.rs`, also called from `world/commands_sort.rs`), `SeatCommand::BattleNet` (`seats.rs`), Alt+N (`flight_ui.rs`, `main.rs`, `input_catalog.rs`, `docs/CONTROLS.md`, the Comms sheet of the keyboard map) and the radio checkpoint coders for `Call::net` and `Channel::battle`. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The battle net repeats a flight lead's contact reports (`Radio::say_to` gains a `battle` flag, set for `Chatter::Contact`) and a human lead's assignment calls (Engage my target and Engage from formation, built from the order voice's own stems; every call of a sort, with the lead's own delays), nothing else: a wingman's report, a fuel or death call and a reply stay on the wing net. Each monitor hears a contact report from its own aircraft, as a flight mate does, with the colour first; an attack call is the lead's, measured from the wingman it names, and is not given the colour twice when it is to the whole flight. The hearers are added after the wing's, so a journal entry of a call reads as the flight's and lists the monitors; an entry is the net's only when no seat heard the call on the wing net. A restart keeps the monitor (a player setting, as radio silence is). The monitor's HUD lines are "Monitoring battle net" and "Battle net off". An AI lead's calls are G4's: it builds its hearers with `battle_hearers`. Two things the build touched outside the row, because it had to: the wire's command coding gains code 23 (`tore-session/src/wire/inputs.rs`, after the wing reply; the protocol version is G7's to bump, as Sort's code 13 was left) and the seat checkpoint coder gains variant 14, and `world/checkpoint_tests.rs` and `world/commands_sort.rs` read the new field and send the sort's calls to the net. Single player: SAME. Tests: `comms::tests` (the monitor and its restart, the hearer's net and the journal's reading, silence on the net), `comms::checkpoint::tests` (the monitor and a pending call's net), `radio_calls::tests` (a lead's report to monitors of other flights with the colour and each monitor's own words, only leads, never the dead or the enemy, a call only the net hears, the journal unchanged without a monitor, silence and the important attack call, the colour for any flight), `world::battle_net_tests` (the crowd fixture with a second flight: Alt+N and its lines, Engage my target repeated at once to the monitor alone, one wingman addressed, a blanket order not repeated, every call of a sort with its 3.5 second spacing, nothing without a monitor), `flight_ui` (Alt+N), the controls test, the seat command's checkpoint and wire round trips. Baseline `m2r-g8` against `m2r-g6-final`: every probe, recording and unit result SAME (314), the only differences two timing lines on a machine at load 25 to 30. |
| G9 Replay events | Sonnet | G3a | `tore-replay/src/vocab.rs`, `tore-app/src/replay/recorder*`, the replay exports and panels, `docs/REPLAYS.md` | `datalink.*` events, summary lines, the Comms panel | Recorded events round-trip; the summary counts them; a golden refreshed; baseline differs only by the new events **Built (G9, 2026-10-05):** `tore_replay::vocab` gains the seven kinds (`datalink.member`, `lock`, `unlock`, `assign`, `clear`, `acknowledge`, `sort_warning`) and the fields `radar`, `target` and `other`; `tore-app/src/replay/recorder/datalink.rs` (`Recorder::drain_datalink`, which the live loop calls after `drain_comms`, and `datalink_drained`, which the AI probe calls with the entries it already took for its `data link:` lines, so the journal is drained once) writes one event for each journal entry and notes a journal that overflowed as a `system.note`. The build settled these, each an agent decision. The journal gains a `SortWarning` entry (`datalink/journal.rs`, pushed by `warning.rs` for each seat that is actually told, so the 10 s cooldown is not bypassed; `DataLink::journal_lost` is the one new accessor), because G6 sent the warning as cues only. Who is the subject and who the object follows the vocabulary's rule (the actor, then the other party): `assign` is the lead then the wingman, with the aircraft in `target`; every other kind is the member then the target aircraft. `clear` carries `reason`, the words `ClearReason::name` already gives (`order`, `receiver lost`, `target lost`, `lead changed`). Each event also has a plain-English `text` for the panels and exports. Every plane is recorded, human or AI, whichever seat the recording is for. The assignment call's words stay in the communication journal's entry for the order, as G3a left them: no separate `comms.radio` entry with a trigger of its own, so the first design's `data link assignment` trigger is gone from the docs. The readers: the Comms panel gains a **Link** chip (a sixth chip at the end, so the five before it keep their places) listing every `datalink.*` kind but `member`, which the exports count; the summary gains a **Data link** section when a recording has any (counts, then each assignment, acknowledgement, clearing and sort warning, with locks counted and not listed); the debug log carries them as it carries any event; the Tacview file's `Debug` events include them; `--recording-diff` has a "data link" category. Capture conversion: the wire carries no `Link` event yet, so `tore-session/src/client/convert/events.rs` is untouched and slice G7 adds the mapping with the event (noted in [REPLAYS.md](REPLAYS.md#network-flights)). Single player: only the new events, see the slice report. Tests: `recorder/datalink_tests.rs` (every entry's event with its subject, object and fields; the overflow note once), `panels.rs` (the Link channel, a row read in words, the filter), `tore-replay/tests/exports.rs` (the golden recording gains the events and its JSONL, summary, Tacview and diff goldens are refreshed; the summary's section and its absence from an older recording), `datalink/warning.rs` (the journal entry for each warning), and replay scenario `replay-rec-datalink` (a probe recorded: every plane a member, the player's lock, the assignment and its clearing by order, equal to the probe's own `data link:` lines, identical twice) |
| G7 Wire | Opus | G6, G8, G3c, G9 | `tore-session/src/wire/*`, `wire-golden.txt`, `tore-session/src/client/*` as needed, the capture conversion's event mapping, `tore-app/src/net/play.rs`, `docs/formats/net-protocol.md` | The two readout parts, the `Link` event, `Sort` and `BattleNet`, the net bit, the converted replay's `datalink` events; the next protocol version | Round trips, lossy rebuild, fuzz; the golden; a seated bot's link readout equals the host's at every snapshot; link bytes measured on the 15 against 15 mission; a `net` lane scenario with a bot receiving an assignment; baseline SAME **Built (G7, 2026-10-06):** protocol 15. `wire/readout.rs` gains the Link scalar group and the link marks, mates and tracks lists (30 parts, `PART_COUNT`); `wire/events.rs` the `Link` event (`LinkEvent`, code 17, the journal entry without its tick) and the radio event's net; `wire/from_world.rs` `link_events` (the entries about the seat's flight) and the net from the call; the host fills the seat's readout's `link` (`prepare_seat`) and queues each tick's entries to the seats of the entry's flight (`sort_seats`), from the journal drained by `journal::drain` into `Driver::take_link`; the client routes `Link` as a seat event, `tore-app`'s presenter ignores it (the cues are in the readout and the warning's line and beep are Message and Radio events); the capture conversion writes `datalink.*` events with `convert::events::datalink_event`; `tore-bot --order N,sort` and every bot prints its Link events, its readout's assignment and its flightmates' marked assignments (`link: ...`). The build settled these, each an agent decision ([protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#data-link-stage-g)): four readout parts, not two, with the marks and mates before the tracks; tracks sent as plain differences, not predicted; no battle net flag in the Link group (nothing reads it; the seat's HUD lines say it); the client lists tracks nearest its own plane first; the Link event carries the assignment's order instead of the dropped delivery bit, and a Member kind; a seat seated later gets no earlier entries; the trails part no longer sends empty counts past its room (found by the new lossy test). Two files outside the row, because the journal is drained there: `tore-session/src/journal.rs` (`Drained::link`) and `host/journal.rs` (`Driver::take_link`); and `bot.rs` and `bin/tore-bot.rs` for the scenario. The mapping from a journal entry to a `datalink.*` event has one home, `tore_session::client::convert::datalink_event`, which the single-player recorder (`replay/recorder/datalink.rs`) and the capture conversion both call. Measured on the 15 against 15 mission (`tests/bandwidth.rs`, now sorting every 5 s while the player leads): 9 bytes a snapshot on average, 247 in the first, at most 146 after it and 1.8 KB in a second, about 280 bytes a second; against protocol 14 on the same flight the packet's mean is unchanged and snapshots with a far entity waiting rise from 310 to 392 of 5,400. Tests: `wire::readout_tests` (the link's numbers, the client's track order, the link's parts under loss, the fight's link under loss), `wire::round_trip_tests` and the fuzz (every Link kind, the net), the golden (protocol 15: the link in the readout samples, every Link kind and a battle-net call in the events, Sort and Battle net in the inputs), `host::tests::a_seated_client_rebuilds_the_hosts_entities_and_own_state` (the seat's readout, link included, equals the host's at every snapshot after the first second, with and without loss, and the tracks change only on publishing ticks), `bot::tests::a_wingman_bot_is_given_a_bandit_by_its_leads_sort_over_the_wire`, `client::convert_tests::events::the_hosts_link_events_become_the_replays_datalink_events`, the `tore-bot` option test, and net scenarios `net-server-datalink` and, after the rebase onto G4, `net-server-datalink-lead` (a bot under an AI lead, weapons free: the lead's assignments to its AI wingmen reach the bot as Link events, readout marks and the call; G4's rule that an AI lead never assigns a human was lifted by slice G11, and the scenario now expects the human's own assignment; the bots print their readout's marks as `link: marked: ...`). Single player: SAME (no single-player code changed). |
| G11 AI leads assign human wingmen | Sonnet | G4, G7 | `tore-sim/src/ai/link.rs`, `ai/mission_leads.rs`, `ai/mission.rs`, `tore-world/src/ai_wings.rs`, `datalink/assign.rs`, `tools/battery_scenarios/net.py` | An AI lead's share and sort reach the human in its wing, with the cues and the call on that seat's channel; nothing forced | `mission_leads` tests for a human in a sort and a share; a world test on the crowd fixture with a human Two under an AI lead; the net scenario `net-server-datalink-lead` expects the human's own assignment; single-player baseline SAME **Built (G11, 2026-10-06):** `LinkInput::wingmen` (`HumanWingman { plane, assigned, idle }`), `LinkInput::wingman_of`, `DataLink::human_wingmen` and `FRESH_ASSIGNMENT_TICKS`, `AiWings::set_link` filling the rows, and `AiMission::lead_commits` over `lead_wingmen` (AI actors that accept a target plus the living, airborne humans of the lead's wing the world described), taking the world snapshot. The build settled the choices under [AI leads and human wingmen](#ai-leads-and-human-wingmen-built-g11), each an agent decision: idle is "no radar lock and no assignment under 30 seconds old"; a sort deals every fit human and says nothing to one that already holds or has locked the dealt bandit; the call keeps G4's delivery to every human of the flight; the yield stays AI-only. Single player: SAME (the player leads its wing). Tests: `ai::mission::leads_tests` (a sort deals a human wingman and an AI one in member order, a human in the second place before the AI behind it, two on one bandit counting the human, a human that holds or locks the dealt bandit is not told again, skipped states, on the ground or down or unknown to the picture, a share to an idle human in member order, not to a busy one, a human's lock counts as an attacker, out of weapons, another wing), `datalink::assign::tests` (the rows: idle, lock, fresh and stale assignments, dead and AI members), `world::datalink_human_leads_tests` (the crowd fixture with seat 1 flying Two of the enemy wing's AI lead: the share to the human with its cues and call, the sort dealing all three with the calls to Two, Three and Four, two equal runs), and net scenario `net-server-datalink-lead`, which now expects the human's own Link event, readout assignment and the call to Two. |
| G10 Acceptance | lead, then John | all | docs | The plan's acceptance: a single-player flight with F/A-18D wingmen shows the cues and voices the assignments; a flight with a radar-less aircraft in it is linked all the same and its player sees every cue but the radar scope's marks (John, 2026-10-05); John approves the differences | Evidence in the slice reports and a `docs/baselines/datalink-<date>.md` **Built (G10, lead's part, 2026-10-06):** [datalink-2026-10-06](baselines/datalink-2026-10-06.md) holds the evidence and the list of single-player differences John approved (G2, G3a, G4, G6, G9). Every check passed and no data link bug was found. The cues and calls were seen in single-player windows (the new `replay-script-link-sort`: Alt+A, three calls 3.5 seconds apart) and the AI lead's sort was heard on the battle net with Alt+N; the radar-less rule was shown with a scratch build that gave the F/A-18D no radar (the scope's marks go, the target window tag, the HUD brackets and the sort warning stay); G7 and G11 were run over loopback (`net-server-datalink`, `net-server-datalink-lead`) and in a real window (the new `net-window-datalink-cues`: the game as Two behind an AI lead sees the call, the blinking diamond, `ASSIGNED BY LEAD` and the brackets). *Agent decisions:* the diamond and the HUD brackets cannot appear in single player, because the player always leads its wing, so they are acceptance-checked in multiplayer only. John's three-machine look is still to come. |
| B1 Radar page NOT INSTALLED (a bug from G10's acceptance) | Opus | G10 | `tore-session/src/wire/readout.rs`, `wire/connection.rs`, `wire/readout_tests.rs`, `client/radar_page_tests.rs` (new), `tools/battery_selection.py`, `docs/formats/net-protocol.md` | In `net-window-datalink-cues` the game's radar page said `NOT INSTALLED` from the busy part of the fight on: find why and fix it on the smallest correct layer | A joined F/A-18D's radar page never says `NOT INSTALLED`; a regression test **Built (B1, 2026-10-06):** not a damage state and not the page: the host's readout of the plane always had the radar. The game's acknowledgements came back over 31 snapshots (1.03 s at 30 Hz) late, after the debug build's 3-second picture stalls and on its 0.6 to 1.3 s round trips, so the host coded every readout against the empty readout; in the 200-byte share the sensor flags (part 21 of 30) waited behind the parts before them once missiles flew, and the client presented the held readout, whose sensor group had not arrived, as no radar, infrared or visual channel. Reproduced headless on the network simulator with a real import (1.1 s round trip, 3-second stalls, the guide's mission as Two). Fixed in the client without a wire change: `ReadoutReceiver::presented`, which `ClientConnection::cockpit_readout` now reads, shows a scalar group that has not arrived since such a restart with what it last arrived with for the same plane, as the design already promised for a group waiting against a held baseline; the baselines stay as the host holds them. *Agent decisions:* every scalar group but the AI locks always holds values, so an empty one is one that has not arrived; another plane's readout starts afresh. Left for the lead (a wire change needs a protocol number): with acknowledgements over 31 snapshots late the readout's lists (contacts, strobes, plots, trails, visual, map, the link's marks, mates and tracks) still never arrive in a busy fight, since every record starts again from the empty readout; a wider baseline field, kept readouts and sent packets would cure it. |

G1, G3a and G6 run together after G0, and G9 joins once G3a merges: their
files do not meet (G1 owns `ai_wings.rs` and the AI mission, G3a the orders
and `world/commands.rs`, G6 the readout and the app's displays, G9 the replay
crate and recorder). G4 and G8 run together. G3c and G8 both edit the
controls list and `input_catalog.rs`, and G3a and G8 both edit
`world/commands.rs`, so those run in order. Stage F's phase 2 also adds keys
(reply and request keys): whichever lands second takes the other's keys into
the controls list, and Alt+A and Alt+N are only proposals until John confirms
them. G6 and G3c both edit `main.rs` (the HUD's assigned target; the probe's order
names); G6 normally merges long before G3c starts, and if they overlap the
second rebases on the first. G7 converts captured `Link` events into the
replay's `datalink` events, so it follows G9.

## Network sessions

Design for stage D of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written by the lead on 2026-09-30, revised the same day after an independent
review, and reviewed by John the same day: his answers are in the guide's
[decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions). It is being built slice by slice; the
[slice table](#how-stage-d-lands) marks each slice that is built.
Every choice here is an agent decision unless it is credited to John. The three
follow-up specs the plan assigns to stage D are:

- the wire protocol: [net-protocol.md](formats/net-protocol.md);
- the netcode numbers: [multiplayer guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#netcode-numbers);
- the dedicated server: [DEDICATED-SERVER.md](DEDICATED-SERVER.md).

In short:

- A **host** runs the mission's `World` on a fixed 120 Hz clock that, once the
  mission flies, never pauses. In stage D the host is the dedicated server,
  `tore-server`, a program with no window, GPU or audio. Stage E puts the same
  host inside a player's game.
- A **client** is a player's game joined to a host. It loads the mission from
  its own import, flies its own aircraft ahead of the host with its own inputs
  (prediction), draws everything else a little in the past between the host's
  snapshots (interpolation), and shows the cockpit readouts the host computes
  for it.
- The flight screen stops reading the simulation directly. It draws a
  **flight frame**: the player's plane and flight state, the picture of the
  mission, the cockpit readout and the tick's cues. Single player fills the
  frame from its own `World`; a client fills it from its session. That is how
  one set of screens serves both.
- Single player does not change. Every slice must compare SAME with the
  single-player baseline; stage D plans no single-player behaviour change.

### Surveys behind the design

Three read-only surveys at `2ada9f8` (kept in the lead's local notes, not
committed) found:

- **No mission can be built without the game app.** `World` has no
  constructor: the creator's Fly button, the AI probe and the tests each
  assemble one by hand in `tore-app` (`Action::MissionFly`, `ai_probe_run`),
  with the creator's list indices, the drawn aircraft (`Airframe::load`) and
  `CombatView` in the path. The import lived
  in the app binary (`assets.rs`, `media_source.rs`), which links the audio
  library, so a Linux server without ALSA could not even start it; slice D3a
  moved it into `tore-import`.
- **The tick assumes a human.** `World::step_with` refuses a tick with no
  human-flown plane; combat's `own()` and `own_id()` panic without an ownship
  and serve "the first ownship" as the presented one; the tick's picture and
  one radio path read `cockpits[0]`. Plane 0 is never an AI actor or a combat
  target row: the creator removes the player's slot from Friendly Wing 1, and
  plane 0 starts from the player's start and layout.
- **The screens read live simulation state.** The HUD, weapon HUD, scope, RWR,
  target window, weapon page, map, seeker tone, RWR tone and situation music
  read the ownship's private combat state and run simulation logic on it
  (`OwnshipView::readiness`, `estimated_hit_percent`, `seeker_tone` and
  others), about 180 call sites. Several are evaluated every frame from the
  frame's interpolated flight, not once a tick. Many places assume that the
  player is aircraft 0.
- **A human plane's part of the tick is small but not only the flight
  model.** One hybrid flight step takes well under a microsecond and needs the
  flight state, the pilot input and the terrain under the aircraft. Around it
  the tick adds building contact (which ground objects still stand),
  turbulence (the cockpit's own state and random stream, and the weather
  clock's reading), the world-edge and OVERSPEED rules, and, every tick, what
  combat writes back: the payload (stores less the external fuel burned), the
  bay held open for a release, radar and jammer forced off by failures, and
  the damage figures. The flight state is 3,256 bytes, 1,512 of them a
  write-only trace.
- **A full mission is cheap to host.** The AI probe's 15 against 15 fight (30
  aircraft) steps in 1.1 to 1.2 ms per tick on the development machine
  (release build, Ryzen 9 7900X): about 14 percent of one core at 120 Hz.
- **The replay coder is a model, not a library.** Its quantization steps and
  bounded reader fit, but it is byte oriented, private to `tore-replay` and
  predicts each tick from the one before, so one lost packet would break it.

### Crates

Stage D adds five crates, all on the standard library only. No new external
dependency. Slice EF-M adds a sixth, `tore-realtime-native`, the hosts'
macOS timing.

| Crate | Kind | Holds | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tore-codec` | library | Bit writer and bounded bit reader, variable-length integers, quantizers, FNV-1a and CRC-32. Shared by the wire, the exact own-plane coder and, in stage H, the checkpoints | std only |
| `tore-net` | library | UDP transport, packet header and checksum, connection handshake, acknowledgements and round-trip time, reliable ordered messages, statistics, and the network simulator. **Built (D2).** The host and client are state machines that never read a clock or touch a socket: the caller passes the time in, feeds them datagrams and sends what they give, over a UDP socket or the simulator (agent decision). *Slice EF3 adds* the in-process link (`link`) a hosting game flies through, and takes from `tore-server` the dual-stack `ServerSocket` (EF-X: it refuses a port another socket holds for IPv4 on every system, [the game port on each system](#the-game-port-on-each-system-ef-x)) and the sleep-then-spin `wait_until`, which the dedicated server and the game's host thread now share ([the host inside the game](#the-host-inside-the-game-stage-e)). *EF4 adds* `Server::set_silence_exempt`, which a hosting game uses for its own player's connection ([the lobby](#the-lobby)). *EF-K adds* the Keepalive packet and the `Keepalive` thread a joined game runs while its loop is stalled ([a stalled game stays connected](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)). *J1 adds* routers to the simulator ([the NAT simulator](#the-nat-simulator)) | tore-codec |
| `tore-import` | library | The data folder, the import pack's reader and writer, media detection and the import itself, moved out of `tore-app` so a server can import and load without the game. *Built (D3a).* | tore-formats |
| `tore-session` | library | The game's side of networking: the wire messages, the host session (clock, inputs, snapshots, joins), the client session (prediction, interpolation, clock steering, readouts) and the headless bot client. *Wire built (D6)*: the module `wire` has every section and message, the cockpit readout's included, with each end's bookkeeping (acknowledged baselines, priorities, the event queue, the name table) and no clock or socket ([what it settled](formats/net-protocol.md#what-the-games-sections-settled)). *Host built (D7a)*: the module `host` ([the host session](#the-host-session)). *Client built (D8a)*: the modules `client` ([the client session](#the-client-session)) and `bot`, and the `tore-bot` program, which loads an import through `tore-import` | tore-world, tore-net, tore-codec, tore-import |
| `tore-server` | binary | The dedicated server: configuration, import, logging and the console. **Built (D7b):** options, configuration file, `--import`, `--check`, start-up refusals, the real-time run loop, the console, status lines and the log, around `tore_session::Host`. The run loop drives the host through a small `Host` trait (`host.rs`) that `wiring.rs` implements with `tore_session::Host`, so the loop, console and log are tested against a scripted host on a fake clock (agent decision). Which build is a release is `app::is_release`, the stamped `TORE_BUILD_VERSION` tag, which the game's `--connect` (D8) must use too. *EF-M:* on macOS its loop runs as a real-time thread and it holds App Nap off for its life (`clock.rs`) | tore-session, tore-import, tore-realtime-native |
| `tore-realtime-native` | library | Keeping a fixed-rate loop on time on macOS: a Mach time-constraint policy for the calling thread and an `NSProcessInfo` activity, latency-critical and user-initiated; no-ops elsewhere. **Built (EF-M)**: the game's host thread and `tore-server`'s loop use it ([sleep and wait accuracy on each system](#sleep-and-wait-accuracy-on-each-system-ef-x)). Its unsafe calls stay inside it, as in `tore-diagnostics-native` | objc2, objc2-foundation (macOS only) |

`tore-sim` and `tore-world` gain `tore-codec` for the exact own-plane state and
the readout coding. `tore-app` gains `tore-session` and `tore-import`. The plan's
`tore-master` is stage I. *Agent decision:* the plan listed `tore-net` and
`tore-server` for stage D; `tore-codec` keeps the simulation crates from
depending on a network crate, `tore-import` keeps the audio library out of the
server, and `tore-session` keeps sockets and threads out of `tore-world`, whose
[rules for mission state](#rules-for-mission-state) forbid them.

### A mission with no window

**The mission as data.** *Built (D3b).* A `MissionSpec`
(`tore_world::mission`) is a Quick Mission written with stable names instead of
the creator's list positions, which differ between installs: the theater code,
the condition (clear, cloudy, foggy, dawn, sunset, night) and any resolved
weather overrides (time of day, wind, cloud deck), the start (airborne
altitude, or the runway object for a ground start), the separation, six wings
(aircraft by its selection key such as `F18.PT`, or `faxx` for the F/A-XX,
which shares `F22N.PT` with the F-22N, count and skill), the preset and group
objectives and survival, guns only, the cheats in force, the flight models (the
hybrid model for the humans, `AllHybrid` for the AI in every networked mission,
John 2026-09-28) and the loadout of plane 0 when a player flies it from the
start. It has a text form of `key value` lines like the preference files
(`MissionSpec::from_text` and `to_text`), which the server's
[mission file](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#the-mission-file) uses and a host sends to
every joining client. Parsing refuses anything out of range and names the
line, and a test parses the guide's own example, so the two cannot drift.
Things the game sets by flag or by environment variable and a server has no use
for (`--enemy-skill`, `--fixture-wings`, `--legacy-flight`, the weather
overrides, the loadout) are fields too, with the creator's defaults when a file
leaves them out. *Agent decision:* a ground start keeps the creator's altitude
setting, because the creator's check that airborne aircraft clear the ground
reads it even then.

**Building it.** *Built (D3b).* `World::new(&MissionSpec, &dyn ResourceSource,
Seating)` builds the mission with no app: the terrain for the theater and
condition under the spec's weather overrides, the aircraft types, the player's
loadout, the layout and the clearance checks, combat and the AI wings, and then
the start, which is `World::restart` run once,
exactly as the creator's Fly button and `restart` did by hand before. The
creator's refusals keep their text (guns only with a missile loaded, ground
start without the hybrid model, altitude under the terrain).
`Seating::SinglePlayer` is today's mission: seat 0 flies plane 0 with the
loadout the spec gives it; `Seating::Open` puts every plane on the AI (below).
`World::build` is the same with the caller's
`Hooks` and returns what the start reported beside the world; the game passes
its own drawn-model loader so that one load of each aircraft type serves both
halves, the player's already loaded type, and the loadout screen's weapon
display names (the simulation's weapon rows carry them, and the screens print
them). A caller that goes on to call `restart` starts the mission a second
time, so the game's Fly builds the world, swaps it in and runs only its own
presentation resets. The creator turns its draft into a spec
(`QuickMission::mission_spec`), single player and the server share the one
path, and the single-player baseline guards it. The simulation half of
loading an aircraft is `AircraftType::load` (`load_type` for an `Arc`): parse,
identity check, sensors, flight model. The engine outlets come from the drawn
shape, so the game's `Airframe::load` sets them on what `load` returns and a
headless host leaves them empty; a client works them out from its own art.

`World::restart` still rebuilds the flight from the `Setup` and the combat the
build made, as it did from the creator's (the population and the accepted
layout persist in combat, which is what a restart of a Quick Mission has
always reused); to rebuild a mission from its spec, which is what a server
does when a mission ends and the next begins, call `World::new` again.
*Correction to the design*, which said restart rebuilds from the spec. The
build applies the spec's cheats through the same `Settings` command the flight
menu sends, and only when they are not the defaults, so a build that set the
AI's guns only is not undone by a command that says nothing. The AI probe
stays on its own path, on purpose: it builds its combat from the aircraft's
default load rather than a creator loadout, edits the creator's draft in place
for its geometry flags, sets up probe-only formation tracing, scripted starts
and pilots between the steps of the build, and never restarts (its `Setup`
carries no AI). Moving it would need probe hooks in the middle of
`World::build` for no gain, since `World::new` is now the headless path.

**Open seating and no human.** *Built (D3c).* `Seating::Open` is a networked
mission: the AI flies every plane, plane 0 included, and humans take planes by
[handoff](#handoff-between-the-ai-and-a-human) and give them back at any time.

- **Plane 0 on the AI.** Friendly Wing 1 keeps its full count
  (`MissionSpec::open_wing_launches`), so plane 0 is the wing's member 0: an AI
  actor that leads the wing, and a combat target row like its wingmen.
  `Combat::open()` starts with no ownship and numbers its aircraft rows from 0
  (`live::State::open_mission`), and the snapshot looks a row's model up from
  the first row's id rather than by `id - 1`. Plane 0 starts from the spawn
  plan like its wingmen (`ai_wings::mission_spawns_for(.., player: false)`),
  on the spot single player's player would take: `restart` works out that
  start (altitude, the layout's turn, the runway) the same way for both and
  places the wings around it. A ground start parks Friendly Wing 1, the wing
  the departure is laid out for, whether or not a human flies in it, plane 0
  on the first slot with the lead's seed. Every AI aircraft flies the hybrid
  model (`AllHybrid`, John 2026-09-28).
- **A tick with no human.** `World::step_with` takes no seat input; combat
  steps with no ownship; the AI gets no human aircraft; the radio, the crew
  voice, the tower and the result checks have no cockpit to serve. Nothing on
  the build, the tick or the handoff calls `Combat::own()` or `own_id()`.
- **Handoff both ways at any time**, plane 0 included, and the last human
  giving back the last plane. A plane given back while its rounds are in the
  air: each round takes its own copy of its station's weapon record
  (`live::State::remove_ownship`), as the AI's rounds carry theirs, so it
  flies on with no ownship to look it up in.
- **The picture.** With no cockpit there is no picture plane
  (`World::picture_plane_if_any()` is `None`) and the render history keeps
  nothing: it is emptied when the last human leaves, and starts over from the
  first cockpit's plane when a human takes one or the first cockpit changes
  hands (*agent decision*: a server draws nothing, so it keeps no history).
  `World::picture_plane()` stays for presenters, which always have a cockpit.
- **Restart.** `World::restart` of an open mission starts it again with every
  plane on the AI: every cockpit and seat goes, and humans take planes again.
  A server starts each new mission with `World::new` anyway.
- **What an open spec refuses** (*agent decision*, refused rather than
  overridden so a mission file says what it flies): straight-flight fixture
  wings (nobody would fly), a player loadout (nobody flies from the start;
  plane 0 carries the AI's standard stores, with Guns only applied as for any
  AI aircraft), and the legacy human or standard AI flight model.
- **Per-plane loadouts.** *Built (EF4).* An open spec's `plane_loadouts`
  are the loadouts the lobby's players chose for the planes they hold
  (`plane-loadout` lines in the text form): the build checks each
  ([the lobby's rule](#the-lobby)) and puts it on that plane's AI aircraft
  (its stores, quantities and fuel), which a human taking the plane keeps
  through the handoff; a plane with none carries its standard load. Single
  player refuses them and keeps plane 0's `loadout` as before.
- **Single player** takes the same path as before: the same start, the same
  build of the AI with its one human, and the baseline compares SAME.

**Resources and the content check.** `tore-import` loads the pack into the
same name-to-bytes map the app uses today. *Built (D3b).* `World::new` reads it
through `ResourceSource`, a read-only lookup that the plain map and
`ResourceReads` both provide (*agent decision:* the view is `ResourceReads`, so
as not to clash with `tore_import::Resources`, the map's name). `ResourceReads`
notes every name the build asks for, present or not, and
`ResourceReads::manifest` gives the sorted names with an FNV-1a 64 hash of each
resource's bytes: the mission's **content manifest**. A name the build asked for
that the import lacks has no hash, so a file one side has and the other lacks
is a difference too, and `Manifest::differences` names them. The theater
catalog the terrain reads to label the theater opens every theater grid, so
all sixteen `.T2` files are in the manifest.
A client builds the same mission from its own import and compares manifests at
join. Only what the simulation reads is compared, so a 1.0 disc import and a
1.02F import play together: slice D3a compared the two imports resource by
resource and found 24 of 4,093 that differ, all menu, dialog, HUD and
mission-module files that differ by four bytes (the link timestamp in their
headers); every aircraft, weapon, sensor, theater, object, shape and radio
resource and every entry the import derives from `FA.EXE` is byte-identical
([result](formats/esa-installer.md#the-import-pack-under-both-builds)). A
difference is refused with the names of the files that differ.

**What a joining client also needs.** The host tick, from which the weather
clock's reading follows (its seconds of day and ticks are a function of the
tick and the mission's start time), and the combat's contrail sortie number,
which sets each aircraft's contrail height. Both travel in the Mission message.

### One step for a human's plane

*Built (D4, the shared step).* The per-plane part of the tick is one set of
functions in `tore-world`, `world::plane`, that `World::step` calls for every
cockpit in the tick's order and a client calls for its own plane with no
`World`, `Combat` or `AiWings`:

1. `fly`: the flight at the start of the tick is kept, the flight steps with
   the pilot's input over the terrain's surface, and building contact is
   tested against the ground objects still standing (a crash, or a rebound
   with no crashes).
2. The weather clock steps; this is the mission's, not the plane's.
3. `after_weather`: turbulence from the cockpit's own state and random stream
   and the weather clock's **reading** at that tick (its native ticks and
   seconds of day, `WeatherReading`), then the world edge and OVERSPEED with
   their message clocks. It returns the warning lines and the turbulence
   shake for the seat.
4. Combat steps, and its step hands each flight to two write-backs with the
   plane's **ownship terms** (`OwnshipTerms`, plain data):
   `take_system_hits` (a systems hit for every subsystem hit the ownship counts
   beyond the flight's own, with the notice for a damaged hardpoint, and the
   crash when the systems are fatal), then, after combat has reacted to that
   crash, `take_combat` (the payload less the external fuel burned, the bay
   held open for a release, radar and jammer forced off, the damage fraction,
   section and regions, the impact report on a damage event, and the crash
   and the pilot's death at no hit points or on a cockpit hit).
5. `take_event` for each of the tick's combat events: a missile blast's jolt
   and the ownship's destruction.

`OwnPlane::step` runs all of these in that order for one plane, after giving
the flight the seat's sensor controls as the command phase does. Single
player keeps its results exactly: the functions are the old code in the old
order, moved, and the tick fingerprint (`world/tick_tests.rs`) did not move.

**One compiled copy (CI-fix).** "The same functions" has to mean the same
machine code. `fly` was generic over the standing objects' iterator and
`World::step_with` is generic over its callback, so the flight step was
compiled again in each crate that instantiated them (the session's host,
at that crate's optimisation level) apart from `OwnPlane::step`'s copy in
`tore-world`. Rust keeps every add and multiply exact, but an optimiser may
still swap library calls: on Apple silicon a sine and cosine pair becomes
one combined call that can round differently. The host and the prediction
then differed by a few units in the last place of the pitch (the network
matrix on macos-14). `fly` now takes a `dyn` iterator and is
`#[inline(never)]`, so one copy in `tore-world` serves both. A new shared
step function should keep to the same rule: not generic over anything the
caller chooses, or not inlined.

What the step reads besides the plane's own state (the flight, the flight at
the start of the tick, the turbulence state and random stream, and the two
message clocks) is an argument:

- the terrain, which a client builds from its own import; the step reads no
  weather clock from it, only the reading it is given;
- the ground objects standing as the tick starts, which a client learns from
  the host's destruction events;
- the weather clock's reading after its step, a function of the host tick
  and the mission's start time;
- the **ownship terms**, what changes during the mission: the 45 subsystem
  hit counts; the radar, visual, infrared and jammer failures; the stores'
  weight; whether a release holds the bay open; hit points; the broken
  section; and the damage taken in each of the six sections, in whole points.
  *Correction to the design*, which listed fewer: the visual and infrared
  failures and the subsystem counts are read too, for the hardpoint notices
  and the systems hits;
- the plane's ownship **configuration**, what the loadout fixes: the damage
  capacity, the external tanks, the stations' names and each sensor's
  hardpoint. *Agent decision:* it is mission data the client already has, like
  the aircraft type, so it stays out of the terms and is never sent;
- the tick's combat events; those about other planes change nothing.

`TickOutput::terms` carries each plane's terms of the tick. The command
phase's rarer flight writes, a mission's new cheats and the payload after a
range command, are not part of the step. The systems messages stay queued on
the flight for the caller, which `World::step` drains into the seat's HUD cues.
A test flies a copy of a plane beside the `World` from tick 600 to 1,200 with
only what the step reads, for the single-player tick mission (turbulence,
gear, throttle, flaps, gun) and for a human wingman of the crowd fixture that
fires, is hit and is shot down, and the copy matches the cockpit to the last
bit, trace included (`world/plane_tests.rs`).

On the host the ownship terms come from combat each tick. A client uses the
terms of its latest snapshot and keeps them until the next one: they change
only when the plane fires, is hit or fails, and the host then sends the exact
state (below). The standing ground objects come from the host's destruction
events.

#### The exact state of a human's plane

*Built (D4).* `world::plane::ExactState` is everything the step reads and
writes that is not the mission's fixed data: the flight state, the cockpit's
turbulence state and random stream, the two message clocks and the ownship
terms the plane last took. It codes against an optional baseline, an earlier
exact state of the same plane the reader also has, and its hash is FNV-1a 64
of its coding with no baseline, the own state hash of the
[snapshot header](formats/net-protocol.md#the-own-aircraft).

- **Coded:** every field of the flight state, the private ones included (the
  hybrid model's state and random stream, the weight-scaled stall factor,
  `lift_g`, the systems with their queued messages, the autopilot, the escape
  and the wreck, the armed ejection), in `tore-sim` beside each type
  (`flight::exact`). Each 64-bit value is the exclusive-or with the baseline's
  (`tore-codec`), so an unchanged field costs one bit; smaller integers and
  enums are coded the same way as 64-bit patterns, flags as one bit.
- **Not coded:** the write-only trace, which equality ignores and the next
  step rewrites; the flight at the start of the tick, which the next step
  overwrites before it reads it (a decoded plane starts with it equal to the
  flight); and the imported tables. The decoder takes the aircraft type's
  flight model as the import builds it and rebuilds the weight-scaled envelope
  polygons from it and the coded scale with the step's own code. The native
  research adapter is refused.
- **Every field named.** Each coder destructures its struct and builds it
  back with every field listed and no `..`, so a field added to any part of
  the state without coding it fails to compile. The two random-stream and
  clock types in `tore-formats` gained accessors for their raw parts, for
  this restore only (lead-approved, 2026-09-30).
- *Agent decisions:* the coding choices above, that is, small values as
  64-bit patterns against the baseline's, the message clocks and queued
  messages coded, the flight at the start of the tick and the ownship's
  configuration left out.
- **Measured:** an airborne hybrid-model plane codes to 331 bytes with no
  baseline and 204 to 226 against its state 4 ticks earlier (tore-sim test);
  with the turbulence stream and terms, the crowd fixture's human wingman
  through its fight costs 163 to 257 bytes, mean 209, against the exact state
  one snapshot back, and 478 bytes with no baseline. That sits at the low
  end of the protocol's 200 to 350 byte estimate.

The acceptance test (`world/plane_tests.rs`) codes a plane at tick 600 with no
baseline, decodes it into a fresh copy with an aircraft type of its own, and
steps the copy to tick 1,200 beside the `World`: for the single-player tick
mission and for a crowd wingman that fires, is hit and is shot down, both on
the hybrid model, the copy equals the cockpit, has the same own state hash and
the same flight at the start of the tick on every tick. Round trips of states
on the ground, airborne, damaged, as a wreck and after ejection, each flying on
identically for two seconds, and decoding of truncated, damaged and random
bytes without a panic, are in `tore-sim`.

### The host session

*Built (D7a), the cockpit readout excepted*, which waits for its wire coding
(slice D5b and D6's second part): `tore_session::Host` (`crates/tore-session/src/host`).
`tore_session::Host` owns the `World` (built with `World::new(spec, resources,
Seating::Open)`), the network endpoint and one record per
connection: its seat, its input buffer, what it has acknowledged and its queue
of events. It is driven by a fixed clock: once the mission flies, 120 ticks a
second of real time, never paused, never compressed. Before that, a server
set to wait for its first player holds the mission at tick 0 and sends no
snapshots, so no client's clock depends on it. If the process falls behind it
runs up to 30 ticks in one go to catch up and logs that the server is
overloaded; it never skips simulated time.

Each tick the host:

1. Applies joins and departures as `MissionCommand::Take` and `GiveBack`.
2. Takes each seated player's input for this tick from that player's input
   buffer: stick, throttle, trigger, scope controls, commands and the tick the
   player's screen showed (for [lag compensation](#hits-and-lag-compensation)).
   A late or missing input repeats the player's last stick, throttle, trigger
   and scope controls with no commands; commands that arrive late are applied
   on the next tick, in order, never dropped. *Since the EF-K follow-up* a
   seat whose game is stalled flies neutral instead
   ([the stall rule](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)).
3. Steps the `World` with every seat's input.
4. Sorts the tick's output: each seat's cues, releases and order replies go to
   that seat's event queue, mission-wide events (effects, marks, destroyed
   objects, ejections, launches, gun bursts, countermeasure releases, sounds)
   to every queue.
5. Notes, for each seat, whether this tick did anything to its plane that the
   player's game cannot foresee: a repeated input, a command applied at
   another tick, a hit, a blast, a release, a change of ownship terms.

Every second tick (60 a second, John 2026-10-06; every fourth, 30 a second,
from 2026-09-28) it builds one snapshot packet
per connection, each seat on its own tick of the interval so that a full server
never builds every snapshot at once (*agent decision, D10 follow-up:* the
seat's phase is its seat number modulo the ticks per snapshot, kept for the
connection, and the client keeps its own-state hashes at those ticks; with 30
players the busiest tick builds 15 snapshots at 60 a second, 8 at 30, not 30): a hash of that player's own plane state; that player's
[cockpit readout](#the-flight-screen-draws-a-frame); the player's
unacknowledged events; and every other aircraft, missile, debris piece and
ejected pilot, coded against what the player has acknowledged, with room kept
for them. When the player's game cannot have predicted its plane exactly (step
5), when it reports a mismatch, and at least once a second, the host also sends
the plane's exact state in a second packet. The
[wire protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#snapshots) has the rules.

The dedicated server runs the host on its main thread: it polls its
non-blocking sockets at least every 4 ms, steps due ticks and sends due
packets, sleeping and then spinning to each tick's deadline
(`tore_net::wait_until`). Stage E runs the same host, with the same loop, on a
thread inside the game ([the host inside the game](#the-host-inside-the-game-stage-e)).

**The calls** (agreed with the server slice, D7b). `Host::new(spec,
resources, HostConfig)` refuses a setting out of range
(`HostConfig::validate`), the retail stall-speed switch and a mission the
import cannot build. The caller passes the time in and moves datagrams:
`receive` or `receive_from` (a socket or the simulator), `update(now)` for
the due ticks, snapshots, timeouts and the lifecycle, `poll_transmit` or
`transmit`, and `next_wake(now)`, the time until the next tick (at most
10 ms), for the socket's wait. The console's commands are `start_now`,
`kick(seat)`, `end`, `restart` and `stop`; `phase()` says where the mission
is. `poll_log` gives every join, refusal, seat change, departure with its
reason, the mission's start, end and restart, overloads and faults, each with
its tick; `status(now)` gives the server's status line (tick, mission time,
players, capacity, aircraft, mean and longest tick cost since the last call,
load as a fraction of one core, overloads, bytes each way) and `players()`
each player's figures (round trip, loss, input arrival spread, input margin,
inputs repeated, bytes each way). The host reads no clock for the mission;
only the tick-cost figure reads the process's clock.

**As built**, each an agent decision unless credited:

- **Inputs.** The buffer keeps each tick's controls once (a repeated or
  forged copy of a tick already held is ignored), drops ticks already stepped
  and ticks more than a second ahead, and gives each tick the view of the
  section's newest tick shifted back by the ticks between. A repeated tick's
  view moves on with it. Commands are numbered from 1 by the player's game,
  so a snapshot's "commands applied" of 0 means none; a number already taken
  is a duplicate, and a command waits for its tick unless it names one more
  than a second ahead. A command that names an already stepped tick is
  applied at the next one and marks the plane's state unforeseeable. At most
  256 commands wait; more ends the connection.
- **The input margin** in a snapshot header is the worst margin of the
  inputs first received since the last snapshot (each tick counted once, when
  it first arrives); with none received it repeats the last figure.
- **No mission command but handoffs.** The host never sends `Settings`: the
  mission file's cheats are applied when `World::new` builds the mission, and
  a default `Settings` would clear the AI's guns-only flag.
- **Gun bursts.** A burst starts with the first new gun round of a shooter's
  gun station and is sent at once with no length; it ends when that station
  fires no round for its weapon's round interval (its burst time times 30
  over its physical rounds, in ticks, as combat's gun cadence spaces them)
  plus 2 ticks, and is then sent again from its first tick with its length.
  A launch event goes out for every new missile, rocket or bomb.
- **"Your aircraft exploded"** comes from the tick's own lines for the seat
  ("Your aircraft exploded", "... on impact"), sent as that event instead of
  a HUD line.
- **Unforeseeable** for a seat: a repeated input, a command at another tick,
  a change of its ownship terms, and any combat event about its plane (it
  fired, was damaged, had a subsystem hit, was destroyed, lost its pilot, hit
  the ground, was jolted by a blast or burst).
- **Relevance.** Distance and a missile aimed at the plane come from the
  positions; the player's own flight is its wing; "tracked by a friendly
  sensor" is a contact or visual contact of any human-flown plane on the
  player's side (the AI's sensors are not consulted yet); the view's subject
  is the input's view subject.
- **Room for messages** in a snapshot packet is what the transport says the
  due reliable messages take (`Server::messages_due_bytes`), at most 256
  bytes, so no entity waits for room a message does not use. New names go in
  a Names message just before the packet that first uses them.
- **Seating.** Seat ids are the lowest free from 0. The Seated message's
  loadout is the plane's stations as they are (weapon, capacity, rounds left)
  and its fuel. A newly seated player's first snapshot queues the mission as
  it stands: every mark and every effect still showing. *Built (D10):* the
  host holds the seat's exact states back until its Seated message is
  acknowledged (the transport reports no more than the count of reliable
  messages still unacknowledged, so every message must be, in practice a
  round trip), at most 3 seconds (`SEATED_HOLD_TICKS`); the state due
  meanwhile goes out at the next snapshot after. The first 3 seconds' hashes
  still flow, so a mismatch is reported and answered as before.
- **A plane that cannot go back.** When a player leaves a plane that is
  destroyed or whose pilot is dead or gone, the AI cannot take it; it stays
  with the departed player's seat, flown with neutral input, and the roster
  keeps that callsign on it. Its seat id is not given out again during the
  mission.
- **Capacity.** A join is refused as full when the connected players reach
  the lesser of `max-players` and the open planes; connections already
  leaving do not count.

### The client session

`tore_session::Client` joins a host, loads the mission and then, every frame:

- **Predicts its own aircraft.** It runs [its plane's step](#one-step-for-a-humans-plane)
  with the player's inputs, one tick per 1/120 s of its own clock, and keeps
  the inputs, commands and states of the last second. Each snapshot carries a
  hash of the host's state of the plane at an earlier tick N; the client
  compares it with the hash of its own state for tick N. Equal, which is the
  normal case on the same platform when the host applied the same inputs,
  means nothing to do. When they differ, the client reports it and the host
  sends the exact state. When an exact state arrives, the client restarts from
  it at its tick, steps its stored inputs and commands again up to now, and
  slides the drawn aircraft from where it was to the corrected place within
  about 150 ms, so a small correction does not jump. Stick and throttle values
  are quantized before the client steps them, so the host steps exactly what
  the client stepped.
- **Keeps its clock ahead of the host.** Inputs for tick T must reach the host
  before it steps T. The host reports, in each snapshot, the smallest margin by
  which the player's inputs arrived; the client runs its clock up to 2 percent
  fast or slow to keep that margin, over the last two seconds, at one tick plus
  one input packet's interval, and one interval more while loss is high, so a
  single lost packet costs nothing.
- **Draws everything else in the past.** Other aircraft, missiles, debris and
  pilots are drawn at a render time a little behind the newest snapshot, about
  100 ms, between the two snapshots around it (a cubic curve through their
  positions and velocities, attitude turned the short way). The delay adapts
  to how steadily snapshots arrive. When one is late the client continues along
  the last motion for up to 250 ms, then holds. Far entities, which the host
  sends only 4 times a second (John, 2026-10-06; twice a second from
  2026-09-30), are drawn further in the past,
  their own update interval plus the normal delay, so they follow the same
  smooth curve and never need guessing ahead; whatever the player's view
  follows is always sent at the full rate. The HUD's target box, the
  target views and the gunsight's lead use a target's drawn pose, the one lag
  compensation judges hits against.
- **Rebuilds what the host does not send.** Smoke, contrails and the fire
  columns of crash sites are regenerated from the drawn aircraft, missiles and
  marks with the simulation's own rules; chaff and flares are flown again from
  their release events, as the replay viewer already does; explosions and hit
  flashes age locally from their spawn; other aircraft's gun rounds are drawn
  from burst events, and its own at once from its trigger. None of these change
  the simulation, which the host alone runs.
- **Presents the cues addressed to it**: HUD lines, radio calls with their
  recordings, the tower, weapon release sounds, rumble, the mission result
  calls, and the debrief the host sends when the player leaves.

A client cannot pause or compress time. The Esc menu, the map and the settings
screens draw over the running flight, and while the pause or Esc menu is up, or
the window has lost focus, the controls go neutral: stick centred, throttle
held, trigger released (John, 2026-09-30). The Restart key is refused in a
session with a message. End Mission leaves the session with the player's
debrief.

*Built (D8b, the game joins a server).* `tore-app --connect` starts a
`NetSession` (`net/session.rs`): the client session,
its UDP socket, the files and the game's own build of the mission. The game's
turn comes at the start of every redraw (`App::net_tick` in `net/play.rs`): the
controls go in (one `Controls` a frame from the keyboard, mouse and
controllers, neutral while the Esc menu is up or the window has lost focus),
the network is pumped, session events become messages, and once the host has
seated the player the flight starts and each frame's `ClientFrame` is what the
screen draws. The mission is built twice before the player asks for a plane:
by the client session for the manifest check, and by the game with its own
loaders (the drawn model of every aircraft type loads as the Quick Mission
creator loads them). The second world is the game's copy of the mission,
never stepped; it holds the terrain, the roster and the aircraft types, the
player's plane is taken in it as a handoff so every screen that reads a
cockpit finds one, and each frame the cockpit is overwritten with the
client's prediction, its readout and its airport service (agent decision). The
single-player world, view, airframe and scenery are set aside and put back
when the session ends. What the single-player tick presenter does once a tick
(HUD lines, speech, tower, rumble, camera weather, blackout, vapor, the
situation music, the warning tones and spatial sound) is done by
`TickPresenter::present_net` once a frame, for the ticks since the last frame
(at most eight; the weather clock catches up in bulk), from the frame and the
events it brought; the events a client has no use for, because their effect
is in the picture or the regenerated devices, are dropped. Messages a session
ends with are plain words on the main menu (kept 12 seconds), and a refused
plane is asked for again as any free plane.

*Built (D8c, gun rounds).* A client draws gun rounds (`net/guns.rs`, with the
round's rules in `tore_sim::combat::gun_round`). The host sends a burst as an
event, not its rounds, so the client makes them again with the simulation's own
rules: the muzzle (the station's mount on the aircraft), the spread
(`live::projectile_launch_direction`), the launch speed, the way a round flies
each tick (the speed command, the 120 Hz service cadence of 2 and 3 units, the
fall, the life) and the cadence the gun releases rounds on. The rounds are
cosmetic: they hit nothing on the client, and hits stay the host's. They join
the picture each frame as ordinary `ProjectilePose`s with `gun: true` and the
tracer flag (every third round), so the existing drawing shows them. Single
player never runs any of it.

- **The seat's own rounds** are drawn at once from its trigger, held while its
  gun is selected and the newest readout says the weapon is ready (the trigger
  is the host's own: the Space key arrives as `TriggerKey` seat commands and
  the controller's button as the controls' trigger, each held by the world's
  `FireInput` rule, and a press made with a menu up or the window unfocused
  fires nothing), with the
  readout's rounds less those the client has let go since the readout's tick.
  `gun_round::Cadence` is combat's trigger and round schedule (the press, the
  rounds waiting, the scaled deadline of the next), so the same rounds leave on
  the same ticks as the host's. The rounds leave the aircraft as drawn (the
  predicted, blended pose) and are flown by client ticks. When the host's burst
  event for the seat's own plane arrives it is not drawn again.
- **Other aircraft's rounds** come from the Gun burst events. A burst's first
  round leaves on the event's tick, and the `n`th at the first tick at or after
  `n` times the weapon's burst time (30 ticks a unit) over its physical rounds
  (`gun_round::release_tick`: the host's cadence with no pause in the burst).
  Each round is placed from the shooter's pose in the picture, taken back along
  its velocity to the round's release tick, with the gun's station mount from
  the mission's usual loadout of the shooter's aircraft type, and flown on to
  the host tick the picture shows. A burst the host has not closed is drawn as
  running on; the closing event (which names the burst by its first tick and
  gives its length) takes back any round that overran it. Because the picture
  is about 100 ms behind the host and a burst is closed within one round
  interval and 3 ticks of its last round, a round that overran is rarely
  drawn at all.
- **Agent decisions (D8c).** The spread of a round is seeded with a number the
  client counts for itself, because the host seeds it with the round's
  projectile number, which no message carries: a client's rounds are on a
  different line within the gun's 0.25 degree half-angle (at most about 26 feet
  from the host's after a second of flight), and with the host's number the
  same code gives the host's positions exactly (the test does both). An
  aircraft's tracers keep the gun's running count of rounds across the bursts
  the client has seen, starting at the first it saw. The shooter's loadout is
  the aircraft type's usual one, since the wire does not carry another
  player's. A burst of a shooter the picture does not hold is not drawn.
  Rounds come in the picture with numbers far above the host's, so a camera or
  the regenerated smoke never takes one for a host's projectile.

*Built (D8b, the game's side that needs no session).* The game's flight
screen has a session mode (`FlightUi::session`): no Pause, time compression or
Restart (each answers with a HUD line), only the three screen-only cheats in
the Cheat menu (`flight_ui::session_menu` hides the rest, with the Pos menu),
and no pause when the window loses focus or a controller drops. While the
Esc menu is up, or the window is not focused, the input context already
returns a neutral pilot (stick centred, throttle held, trigger released), so
a session passes it on as it is; `FlightUi::stopped()` says whether time is
stopped (never in a session) apart from `frozen()`, which says a menu has the
keyboard. Chaff, flares, smoke and contrails are regenerated by
`regen::Effects`, stepped once per client tick from the picture: motor smoke
while a missile's motor burns (dated from the tick the picture first shows the
missile, so a missile can be a tick or two off the host's), damage smoke from
an aircraft at half its hit points or less, crash-site columns, contrails above
each aircraft's onset altitude, and releases flown with the replay's own
`regen::release_device` and `regen::fly_devices` (the replay viewer now
uses the same two functions). A received debrief converts back into the debrief
screen's report (`net/debrief.rs`) and closes to the main menu. The combat
view can show a picture it is given and be built for a loadout the host sent.

*Built (D8a), headless:* `tore_session::Client` (`crates/tore-session/src/client`),
with no window or audio; slice D8b wires it into the game. The game's
regeneration of smoke, contrails, chaff, flares and tracers from the frame is
D8b's.

**The calls.** `Client::connect(ClientConfig, resources, now)` starts the
join (server, callsign, password, build, the plane wanted or any, the entropy,
and the platform, this build's own by default; it refuses the retail
stall-speed switch). The caller drives it like the host:
`receive` or `receive_from`, `update(now, &Controls)` with the pilot's held
controls and the commands given since the last update (`Controls::neutral`
while a menu is up), `poll_transmit` or `transmit`, and `next_wake(now)`.
`frame(now)` gives a `ClientFrame` once seated: the predicted flight and the
presented one, the picture at the render time, the newest cockpit readout, the
plane's configuration and the events released since the last frame;
`ClientFrame::flight_frame` makes the screens' `FlightFrame` from it with the
game's smoke and devices. `poll_event` gives the session's events (connected,
mission loaded, content refused, seat refused, seated, roster, notice,
debrief, mission ended, closed with its reason; EF4 adds the lobby, refused
and goodbye). `leave(now)` sends Leave, which ends the player's flight (EF4:
the player stays in the lobby); `leave_game(now)` ends the flight and quits
once the debrief is in; `disconnect(now)` quits at once. `mission()` is the
client's copy of the mission, `roster()`, `name(index)` and `stats()` the
rest. `set_mission_builder` lets the game build the mission with its own
hooks. The lobby's calls are [the lobby's](#the-lobby).

**As built**, each an agent decision unless credited:

- **Joining.** On the Mission message the client builds the mission from its
  own import with `World::new(spec, resources, Seating::Open)`, never stepped,
  and compares the manifest its build read with the host's: a difference sends
  Content refused with the names (EF4: and the reason; the player stays in the
  lobby, marked unable). Then Ready with the
  plane wanted (EF4: Take plane, by the automatic ready). On Seated it finds the plane's aircraft type and ownship
  configuration in its copy of the mission as the host's handoff does (the AI
  wings' record, else the mission's for the type), decodes the exact state with
  that type's flight model, and starts its prediction; the standing ground
  objects are the mission's less the Seated message's destroyed list. Own
  states that arrive before the Seated message (they overtook its fragments
  until D10, when the host began holding them back; a client still keeps
  them) are kept, by the baselines they name, and read once it has arrived:
  the transport has acknowledged them, so the host codes the next against them.
- **Prediction.** Each predicted tick quantizes the controls as the wire does,
  numbers the commands given since the last tick from 1 (wrapping), and runs
  `OwnPlane::step` with the seat's sensors, the standing objects, the weather
  clock's reading at that tick, the ownship terms of the latest exact state and
  no combat events. The reading is a function of the tick, the clock having
  stepped once per tick from tick 0 (`prediction::weather_at`, checked against
  the host's world each tick). The plane's queued systems messages are dropped
  after each step: the host sends them as the seat's HUD lines. The predictor
  keeps 240 ticks of controls and commands and the own state hash at each
  snapshot tick.
- **Inputs.** One Inputs packet when a tick was stepped since the last and at
  least 1/60 s has passed, with every tick from the host's newest received one
  (snapshot header) to now, at most 24; every command the host has not applied
  whose tick the client has reached; the view offset to the drawn time and the
  interpolation delay in whole ticks; and the newest snapshot tick whose own
  state hash differed.
- **Reconciliation.** An exact state equal to the prediction at its tick
  changes nothing. One that differs restarts the plane at its tick and steps
  the stored ticks again, and the drawn plane keeps where it was and slides to
  the new path with a 50 ms time constant; over 100 ft or 20 degrees, within a
  second of seating, or under 0.01 ft and 0.01 degrees it does not slide. One
  for a tick the client has not reached is taken as it is. *EF4:* exact
  states are read on arrival and applied after the update's steps, only the
  newest, and held (at most 125 ms from when the hold began) while the host
  still reports repeating
  the seat's late inputs; ticks the host has stepped without the seat's input
  are predicted with the controls the host repeated
  ([the stall](#the-lobby)).
- **The clock.** Seating sets the predicted clock ahead of the Seated tick by
  a round trip and the margin. The initial forecast through that tick uses neutral
  input, matching the host before it receives the first controls. Held controls
  and queued commands begin on the following predicted tick. This fitted client
  initialization rule avoids applying new input retroactively to the elapsed
  seating interval; commands are retained, not discarded. A synthetic test holds
  nonzero roll and rudder and sends an immediate airbrake command across 60 and
  120 ms round trips, requiring zero mismatches from startup and command delivery.
  The first margin the host reports after it has
  had an input from the seat sets the clock outright, whatever the size: the
  Seated message can be late by retransmitted fragments, and seating snaps
  anyway (*correction to the design*, which jumped only past 250 ms). After
  that the rate is 1 plus 1 percent for each tick of margin error, within 2
  percent, and the clock jumps only past 30 ticks. Each margin is judged
  against the clock that sent the inputs it measured, a round trip earlier, so
  the two-second minimum does not make the steering overshoot. The target is 3
  ticks, 5 while the client's own packets lost more than 1 percent over 10
  seconds. *EF4 follow-up (agent decisions):* only a snapshot whose
  newest input tick is newer than the last one measured gives the clock a
  margin, since one that has had no new input repeats the last figure; and a
  clock that is not ahead of the host's newest snapshot tick (a starved or
  stalled game, whose inputs would all come late and none be sent) jumps
  ahead of it as seating sets it, by a round trip and the margin, and counts
  in `ClientStats::behind`. Before, such a client sent no inputs, so its
  stale margin held the clock behind and the host's state of its plane was
  taken at every own state, some 30 to 130 ft a time, for as long as it
  lasted.
- **The drawn time.** The newest snapshot tick is estimated as a line through
  their arrivals (each moves it a twentieth of the way). The interpolation
  delay is raised at once to keep the drawn time 2 ticks (6 while snapshots
  lost more than 1 percent over 10 seconds) behind the newest snapshot over
  the last 2 seconds, lowered only after 2 settled seconds, kept within 6 and
  30 ticks, and slides at a tenth of real time; the drawn time never steps back
  by less than 250 ms.
- **Entities.** Each keeps its states by tick and is drawn at the drawn time
  less its own extra delay: the gap between its last two states once that is 4
  snapshots or more (at most a second), none once it is 2 or fewer, sliding
  at a tenth of real time once drawn. An entity heard of once and not again
  within 4 snapshots is a far one from the start, drawn its interval back.
  Positions follow the cubic curve, attitudes `Basis::blended`, projectile
  directions and pilot headings the short way, devices blend, the rest is the
  earlier state's. Past its newest state an entity goes on for at most 30
  ticks, then holds; from its removal's tick it is not drawn.
- **The frame.** The presented flight is the prediction blended by the
  clock's fraction of a tick, plus what is left of the correction's offset.
  The picture is the render time's: the own plane as the player pose (as
  combat draws it, with the latest terms' damage), every other aircraft, the
  mission's ground objects (destroyed from their event's tick), projectiles,
  debris (the own plane's drawn with its airframe), pilots (the own one from
  the prediction's escape), effects aged from their events and marks from
  theirs. A mark's fire is drawn at full strength: its remaining life is not on
  the wire (a known difference until the host sends it). The readout is the
  newest received, its contacts placed around the presented flight
  (`ClientConnection::cockpit_readout`).
- **Events.** The seat's cues are released on arrival, since they belong to
  the player's own predicted plane: HUD lines, radio, tower, order voice and
  replies, weapon cycled, release sounds, rumble and "your aircraft exploded".
  The mission-wide ones are released when the picture reaches their tick, so
  an explosion shows and sounds where the missile is drawn (lead decision,
  2026-09-30): effects, marks, sounds, countermeasure releases, gun bursts,
  launches, ground objects destroyed and wing ejections. A ground object's
  destruction reaches the prediction's standing objects on arrival.
- **Diagnostics and capture.** `set_diagnostics` and `set_capture` take
  writers ([below](#recordings-and-diagnostics)). For a capture's replay the
  client draws its join's random seed itself, from the system for
  `Entropy::System`, and seeds the transport with it.
- **The bot.** `tore_session::bot::Bot` flies a client with a scripted pilot.
  With nothing to pursue it flies straight and level and turns, a 40-second
  cycle holding its altitude. *Built (BOT, 2026-10-05):* it pursues the nearest
  aircraft of the other side within 12 nm (kept until another is 1.5 times
  nearer) and shoots it. Far off it flies an intercept course (the time to
  meet from the quadratic, bank for the heading, all the pull when the aim is
  more than 35 degrees off the nose); inside 6,000 ft the aim is the gun's
  lead point. The lead comes from the gun itself: the loadout of the client's
  frame, solved with the gunsight's own ballistics (`gunsight::solve_observed`,
  the AI's solver), the target's acceleration from its velocity over a quarter
  second added, aimed at the target **where the shooter's screen has it**,
  because the host judges a gun round against the targets as the shooter saw
  them ([hits and lag compensation](#hits-and-lag-compensation)). Near the
  nose it holds the wings level and tracks by pull and rudder, damped by the
  aircraft's own rates, with a slow trim for the steady error (a thin-air pitch
  trim). It fires while the line of fire passes within 40 ft of where the round
  will meet the target (55 ft to keep firing), from 6,000 ft to 450 ft, and
  takes a snap shot inside 7,000 ft at 300 ft, so that a fight with an
  aircraft that turns still has its bursts. A pull of the trigger lasts at
  least a quarter of a second, with 150 ms between pulls. A pass head on is
  not flown through: at 1,500 ft the bot breaks up and to the right, which
  separates two bots (each breaks to its own right, so on opposite sides); an
  overtaken target is cleared at 450 ft the same way. The throttle is full
  while the target is far or ahead, and its speed and a little more when the bot
  is behind it and close.
  *Agent decisions (BOT):* the numbers above were fitted on the simulator
  against the real import (a dummy at 2, 5 and 10 nm and three heights: 17 of 18
  fall within a minute, the miss being 2 nm at 40,000 ft, where the 8-second
  approach is short for the pitch trim; two bots on the guide's mission end it by
  the kill limit about 18 seconds in, on links of 0 to 160 ms), not taken from a
  retail document. Two bots that merge head on, both aligned, usually shoot each
  other down on the one pass (a kill each, a draw); the scenario takes that as a
  finish. A kill a player scores on the AI's aircraft counts, and the AI's
  missiles kill a bot on the AI's side about 15 seconds in on the guide's mission,
  so the PvP scenarios put the AI on weapons hold.

  `tore-bot` (`--connect`, `--data-dir`, `--count`, `--callsign`, `--slot`,

  chat lines) runs bots against a server over UDP and exits 0
  when every bot was seated, got its debrief and left.

**Measured** (`client/tests.rs`, synthetic resources on the network
simulator unless said; debug build):

- One client flying straight, level and turning for 5 minutes at a 60 ms
  round trip with no loss: its own state hash was compared at 9,090
  snapshots and never differed; no exact state changed the prediction, even
  at seating; the input margin settled at 4 ticks.
- Two bots fighting the enemy for 5 minutes at a 150 ms round trip, 2 percent
  loss each way, 1 percent duplicated and arrivals spread by 10 percent of
  the one-way delay: 18 and 6 exact states changed the prediction, all in the
  first seconds after seating while the clock settled (a 20-second run counts
  the same), none blended, so no snapshot needed a visible correction; the other aircraft were drawn within
  1 ft of the host's position at the same moment in 99.8 percent of frames and
  within 3 ft in 99.9 (the worst, 186 ft, a far aircraft held after a lost
  update); 0.49 and 0.56 percent of entity frames were drawn past their
  newest state; the host repeated 0.06 and 0.18 percent of the bots' input
  ticks; both left with their debriefs. The first bot's capture, 9.4 MB,
  replayed offline into the same 18,774 frames and the same inputs, byte for
  byte.
- Over real UDP on 127.0.0.1 a bot flew a minute against an in-process host,
  and two `tore-bot` bots flew a minute against a release `tore-server`
  with a real import (the guide's 12-aircraft example mission): both were
  seated, got their debriefs and left cleanly, at a 4 ms round trip, a 57 ms
  interpolation delay and an input margin of 4 ticks.
- *D10:* the whole matrix of nine round trip and loss cells, five minutes each,
  passes every limit; the numbers, and the host cost and bandwidth on a 15
  against 15 mission with 2 to 30 bots, are in the
  [baseline](baselines/net-2026-09-30.md).

### The flight screen draws a frame

Today the flight screen reads `World` directly. Stage D puts one plain-data
**flight frame** between them:

| Part | Single player fills it from | A client fills it from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The presented seat and its plane id | seat 0 and plane 0 | the seat and plane the host gave it |
| The plane's flight state now and at the start of the tick | the cockpit | its prediction |
| The mission picture: every other aircraft, ground object, missile, round, effect, mark, debris piece and pilot | `RenderSnapshot` as today, built for the presented seat | interpolated entities and local effects |
| Smoke, contrails, chaff and flares | combat | regenerated locally |
| The cockpit readout | built from `World` for the seat, every frame as today | the newest readout in a snapshot |
| The tick's cues and launches for the seat | `TickOutput` | events from the host |
| Mission data that never changes: terrain, aircraft types, ground objects, the roster's slots, sides and names, the weapon rules and range mode | `World` | the client's copy of the mission |

The **cockpit readout** is what the seat's displays show, computed where the
simulation state lives: stores and the selected station, arming, readiness,
the seeker's state and tone, the estimated ranges, hit percentage and firing
band, the designated, displayed and view targets, radar, infrared and visual
contacts with their trails, the map contacts, RWR emitters and missile records,
the RWR tone's inbound missiles and locks, damage and faults, chaff and flares,
shots, hits and kills, the airport service's state, NAV mode, the target
window's readout, the situation music's inputs and the mission result. Contacts
are sent with their positions in the world, so the client draws them around its
predicted aircraft. The friendly list the designation keys skip follows from
the roster's sides.

`tore-world` builds it (`World::cockpit_readout(seat, launcher)`) from the
seat's ownship and a launcher, the plane's position, attitude and speed. Single
player builds it every frame from the frame's interpolated flight, exactly
where the weapon HUD and the seeker tone compute today, so its captures stay
byte-identical; a host builds it at each snapshot from the tick's flight.

Every "aircraft 0 is the player" assumption in the screens (the view rig's
player body and missile owner, the RWR tone's owner, the target window's
viewer, spatial sound's own aircraft, `ai_wings::PLAYER_ID` in presentation)
reads the frame's plane instead, and `Combat::snapshot` builds the picture for
any seat. The view rig learns of every missile launch from launch events, so a
missile that lives less than one snapshot is still the F12 view's last missile.

*Built (D5a, the frame).* `tore_world::frame::FlightFrame` is the plain-data
frame, with nothing in it that draws:

| Field | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `seat`, `plane` | The presented seat and the plane it flies |
| `flight`, `previous` | The plane's flight as the last tick left it, and at the start of that tick |
| `presented` | The flight to draw: `flight` and `previous` blended to the frame's instant, or `flight` for a tick's frame and a frozen flight |
| `picture` | The presented `RenderSnapshot` for the seat: its plane is the `player` pose and every other aircraft is a target |
| `smoke`, `devices` | The puffs of hits, wrecks and motors and the contrails; chaff and flares |
| `tick_cues` | The cues of the tick being presented; `cues()` yields the seat's own and the mission-wide ones with their place in the tick |

The fields borrow, because the smoke holds tens of thousands of puffs;
`presented` is a `Cow`. `World::flight_frame(seat, presented, picture, cues)`
fills a frame from the `World`, and `World::presented_flight(seat, alpha)`
makes the blended flight. The app owns the tick fraction and the interpolated
picture (`CombatView::presented`), so it passes both in; a client session will
pass what its own clock and interpolation give. The redraw builds one frame
after the tick loop and every camera, panel, HUD and sound below reads it. The
per-tick presenter builds a short-lived frame for each thing it reads, because
it also calls methods that need the app mutably.

`Combat::snapshot(plane, flight, wings)` is the picture for any plane that has
an ownship: that plane is the player pose, in the flight given, and every
other human-flown plane, the first one too, is an ordinary target drawn from
the pose its last step left (combat now keeps a pose for every ownship, not
only the ones after the first). `restart_render`, `advance_render` and
`refresh_render` take the plane as well. The mission's render history is built
for one plane, `World::picture_plane()`, the first cockpit's (agent decision):
a host that serves other seats builds theirs with `snapshot`. With no cockpit
it keeps none (D3c).

The "aircraft 0 is the player" reads are gone from the screens: the view rig
(`Scene::new(plane, ..)`, `Rig::for_plane(plane)`: the scene's player body,
the wing group of the player, what counts as the player's own missile and the
inbound-threat view), the RWR tone, the flight music (which now also counts
only its own plane's damage, where it counted every ownship's), the target
window's viewer, the map, the scope, the weapon HUD, the status line and the
damage report. The app's own reads of the first ownship (`state.own()`,
`own_view()`) became reads of the frame's plane, which slice D5b then replaced
with the cockpit readout (below). `ai_wings::PLAYER_ID` is no longer read by the
screens; it stays in the AI wings module and two headless probes. Left as they
were, on purpose:
the headless probes, the ordnance and combat smoke checks and the replay
recorder, which build a combat with one ownship and have no presented seat.

Single player's camera views are still built from combat's target rows
(`Scene::new`). A client has no combat to read, so the scene of the F5 to F12
views can also be built from the frame's picture alone (`Scene::from_frame`,
*built in D8b*): another human's plane is then a subject of the target and wing
views like any AI aircraft. The replay viewer builds its scene the same way
(`Scene::of_picture`, with its fly-by direction), and a test checks that the
two scenes agree on the fixture crowd.

*Built (D5b, the readout).* `tore_world::readout::CockpitReadout` is the
plain-data readout, with no reference into combat. `World::cockpit_readout(seat,
launcher)` builds it (`Combat::cockpit_readout(plane, launcher, wings, cockpit)`
does the work; `readout::build` is its body), and `FlightFrame::readout` holds
it, built by `World::flight_frame` from the launcher of the flight the frame
presents. Every list has a limit (`MAX_CONTACTS` and the others in
`readout.rs`); a longer one keeps the entries nearest the plane. The groups are
the wire's:

| Group | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| Header | The plane and the combat tick (the warning tone's clock) |
| `stores` | The selected station, arming, launch mode, the rounds at every station (failed ones marked) and which stations were loaded at the start |
| `seeker` | The mounted seeker's status, target and observation, and the tone it plays |
| `estimates` | Readiness, guidance available, can lock, the HUD's observation, maximum range, favourable firing band, in range, hit percentage and the flight seconds to the target |
| `targets` | The designated identity, and the displayed and view targets (the view target is the sight hold) as rows: identity, aircraft, position, velocity, hit points and damage by section |
| `sensors` | The sensors' step count, selected and acquired target and its track status, which channels are installed and operating, the radar's track range, radar and infrared contacts (with world positions), stale plots, noise strobes and the contacts' trails |
| `visual` | Visual contacts |
| `map` | Map contacts with whether a visual return identified them, whether they fly, and what an identified aircraft is |
| `rwr` | Passive emitters, the threat service's missile records, the missiles in flight aimed at the plane (for the warning tone and the music) and the seeker classes of the locks the AI holds on it |
| `damage` | Hit points, damage, the subsystem hit counts, the five failure flags and the plane's shots, hits and kills |
| `countermeasures` | Chaff and flares left |
| `airport` | NAV mode and the tower's service (selected airport, clearance, which runways are down) |
| `target_window` | What the AI says of the displayed target: the objective, and whether it is a fixture or an AI pilot with its activity and skill and whether it aims at the viewer |
| `music` | The designated target when it is a live enemy aircraft, the AI aircraft aiming a missile at the plane, and the mission result and home latch |

What stays out of it, because the client has it or it is the picture's: the
loadout (`FlightFrame::config`, the weapon records of the plane's stations,
changed only when the stores are loaded), the airport scene, the roster's sides
and names, the weapon rules, and the target rows the camera views are built from.
Single player builds it every rendered frame from the frame's interpolated
flight, where the weapon HUD and the target cue draw; the instruments, the
scope's reprojection and the target window's bearing use the flight as the last
tick left it, as before; and the seeker tone is the readout of the tick frame,
as before. Per-tick readers (the RWR tone, the situation music, the view rig's
target) read the readout of the tick's frame. The frame's readout is built when
a display first reads it (`ReadoutSlot`), and the frames of one tick share one
build (`World::flight_frame_sharing`), so a windowed tick builds it once and a
rendered frame once more; `OwnshipView::at(launcher)` works the observation and
the firing solution out once for all the estimates. The navigation page still
reads the plane's tower service from its cockpit, at the start of each tick. The app
reads it in `weapon_hud`, `scope`, `combat_view`, `flight_map`, `flight_views`,
`flight_music`, `rwr_tone` and the redraw; `combat_view::PlaneState` is gone.
The airport group holds a clone of the plane's `airport::Service`, for the ILS
guidance and the navigation page, which ask it questions every frame (agent
decision: a clone keeps the guidance exact between ticks). What the wire needs
of it is the selected airport, the clearance and which runways are down.
Measured plain (every field at its natural width, no coding): a busy seat of the
crowd fight is about 2.5 KB, of which the radar contacts and their trails are
most; a contact is 77 bytes and a trail point 24 bytes at that width, and the
wire's quantization and its changed-group bits are D6's to count against the
200-byte budget.

The sound's own aircraft is fixed: `tore_sim::acoustics::Listener::own` names
the aircraft the listener flies, and `Passes::step` takes that aircraft's source
as its own. `audio::spatial_sources` labels every source with its plane's id, and
the replay's sources and listener use the recorded player's id, so the reserved
`u32::MAX` relabel is gone.

### Hits and lag compensation

*Built (D9).* The host decides every hit. Missiles, rockets and bombs are
simulated only on the host and are not rewound (John, 2026-09-28).

Gun rounds fired by a human are tested against targets **as the shooter saw
them** (John, 2026-09-28). Each seat's input names the host tick its screen
showed (V) for the tick the input is for (T), and its interpolation delay:
`SeatInput::view`, a `SeatView { tick, interpolation_delay }` (`seats.rs`),
which the wire slice fills from the input's view offset and delay. `None`, as
single player, the AI probe and every local seat give, means no rewind.
Because the player's game runs ahead of the host and draws other aircraft
behind it, `T - V` is the whole round trip plus the interpolation delay plus
the input margin. *Correction to the plan*, whose estimate of half the round
trip plus the delay measured from the input's arrival was too small. A round
fired on tick T carries a rewind of `T - V` ticks, of which the part beyond the
interpolation delay is capped at 30 ticks (250 ms), as the plan capped latency:
a player on a very slow link is judged against where targets were 250 ms plus
the delay ago, never earlier. The rewind is at most 60 ticks (500 ms).
`combat::gun_rewind` (`tore-world`) computes it; a view of tick T or later is
no rewind.

```mermaid

  history["one second of hit volumes<br/>recorded every tick"] --> search
  fire --> search["hit search, every tick of the flight:<br/>each aircraft's volume from now - rewind"]
```

**The history.** Combat (`tore-sim`, `combat/live/rewind.rs`) records, once a
tick, every aircraft's hit volume exactly as the hit search reads it: position,
the position a tick before (a gun round is tested in the aircraft's moving
frame), attitude and radius, for the AI's aircraft rows and every human-flown
aircraft. It records where the search reads the current volume, after the AI
rows have moved for the tick, and keeps 120 ticks (1 second). Ground objects do
not move and have none. The history and the rewinds of the rounds in flight
live in `live::State`, inside `World`, since the hit search runs in
`World::step`; they are mission state, so stage H's checkpoints will carry them
([rules for mission state](#rules-for-mission-state)).

**The rewound search.** On every tick of its flight a round with a rewind tests
each aircraft against its volume from `now - rewind` instead of the current one.
An aircraft with no entry that far back (it did not exist yet) is tested at its
oldest entry. Everything else is today's code: which aircraft can be hit, the
nearest contact, damage, the ledger, friendly fire and the launcher's own
volume rule use the aircraft as it is now. A round with no rewind (every AI
round, every missile, rocket and bomb, and every round in single player) takes
exactly today's path. `World::step` hands `Combat::step_all_rewound` each
human-flown plane's rewind, and combat gives it to the gun rounds that plane
fires on the tick.

*Agent decisions (D9):*

- The rewind of a round is kept beside the rounds (`State::rewind_of`, by
  projectile number), not in `Projectile`, whose many literals in the app and
  the AI would all have changed; a round that ends takes its rewind with it.
- The damage section of a rewound hit comes from the volume the round was
  tested against, and the hit's effect is moved from that past volume onto
  the aircraft as it is now, so the sparks show on the aircraft every screen
  draws instead of up to 500 ms behind it.
- Whether an aircraft can still be hit (alive, not the shooter, friendly fire)
  is decided on its state now, not its state then: a target destroyed since
  the shooter's view is not hit again.

A client draws its own tracers at once from its trigger and its predicted
aircraft, and other aircraft's bursts from the host's burst events (shooter,
gun, first and last tick); *built (D8c)*, see [the client
session](#the-client-session). A missile appears on the client when the host
launches it, one round trip after the trigger (about 0.15 s at 150 ms), since
only the host knows whether the launch was ready.

```

- **Which plane.** A joining player asks for a plane
  by id (`--slot`) or takes the first free friendly plane, Friendly Wing 1's
  lead first (in the lobby, EF4, by taking that plane's slot). The server's configuration lists the planes open to humans
  (default: every friendly plane). A plane that is destroyed, has lost its
  pilot or is flown by a human cannot be taken. *Built (D7a):* a refused
  plane gets Seat refused with the reason and the player may ask again; with
  `open-planes all` a player asking for any plane gets the first free
  friendly one before any enemy one.
- **Callsigns.** A callsign already in use gets a suffix (`Viper_2`, John
  2026-09-28), shortened first if the whole would pass 15 characters.
- **Loadout.** A player keeps the loadout of the aircraft they take, the late
  joiner's rule of the [guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#slots-ai-fill-and-handoff).
  A player in the lobby chooses one for its slot before the mission
  (*built, EF4*, [the lobby](#the-lobby)).
- **Leaving.** End Mission sends Leave; the host builds the player's debrief
  (`tore_world::debrief::capture` for the seat, moved out of the game in D7a
  so the server can build it; the game keeps the screen), sends it, and gives
  the plane back to the AI at the next tick. *Built (D7a):* the host then
  disconnects the player once the debrief is acknowledged, or after 5 seconds.
  A player whose packets stop for 5 seconds, or who is kicked, gives the plane
  back the same way with no debrief; *since EF-K* a joined game whose loop is
  merely stalled keeps its plane for up to a minute
  ([below](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)). A
  destroyed plane stays destroyed; the seat can end the mission as in single
  player. Respawns are stage F. *EF4:* Leave ends the player's flight only:
  after the debrief the player is back in the lobby, still connected, and
  leaves the game by disconnecting (`Client::leave_game` does both).
- **The end.** When the host ends the mission, every seated player gets
  "Mission ended" and their debrief. *EF4:* with a next mission every
  player stays connected, back in the lobby with its slot and loadout and its
  ready mark cleared ([the lobby](#the-lobby)); only a host that stops
  disconnects them, as follows. *Built (D7a), and since EF4 only when the
  host stops after the mission:* Mission ended goes first, then
  the debrief; every connection, seated or not, is disconnected with "server
  stopping" once they are acknowledged or after 5 seconds; a join while the
  mission is ended is refused as shutting down with the seconds to the next
  one. The console's `end` and `restart` send the end reason "ended by the
  server" ([protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#messages-as-built)); `quit`
  disconnects everyone with "server stopping" and sends no debriefs. The empty
  timeout counts from the moment the last seated player leaves (sends Leave
  or is dropped). The dedicated server's rules for starting,
  ending and restarting are in the [server guide](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#the-mission-lifecycle).
- **Settings.** The mission's cheats come from the server's mission file and
  apply to everyone. On a client the Cheats menu keeps only the settings that
  change nothing but its own screen (no sun whiteout, no G effects, no screen
  shake). The retail stall-speed switch (`--retail-stall-speeds`) is a
  developer option for the whole process: a server refuses to start with it
  and a client refuses to join with it, so every machine flies one
  configuration.
- **Builds.** John's rule is that the build must match
  ([guide](MULTIPLAYER.md#compatibility-handshake)). *Agent decision on what
  that means:* two tagged release builds match when their versions are equal;
  any other build must have the same commit, since compile-time tuning (for
  example the stall reference fractions) changes the simulation and would make
  every prediction wrong.

### A stalled game stays connected (EF-K)

*Built (EF-K); agent decisions unless credited.* A host drops a connection
it has heard nothing from for 5 seconds. A joined game's loop can stop for
longer than that and still come back: EF6 and EF7 both saw a screenshot on a
loaded machine stall a joined game past 5 seconds, and the host dropped it.
A player whose window stalls should come back to their flight, not to a
"disconnected" message.

**What stalls the loop, by platform.** Read from the source of winit 0.30.13,
the version in `Cargo.lock`, on 2026-10-01; none of it has been checked by a
run on Windows or macOS yet. The game pumps its session only at the start of
a redraw (`net_tick` on `RedrawRequested`, `net/play.rs`), and `about_to_wait`
asks for the redraws, with `ControlFlow::WaitUntil` no later than the
session's next wake, about 10 ms (`main.rs`).

- **Windows.** Dragging the title bar or a border runs the system's modal
  move and size loop inside `DefWindowProcW`. Winit emits `about_to_wait` and
  honours `WaitUntil` only from its own wait (`wait_for_messages`,
  `platform_impl/windows/event_loop.rs`), which does not run until the drag
  ends. Window messages still arrive: each size change gives `Resized` and,
  since the game asks for a redraw on every resize, a `RedrawRequested` that
  pumps the session once. A move, a mouse button held still on the title bar,
  and the title bar's right-click menu pump nothing for as long as they last.
  Winit cancels the half-second pause of a plain click on the title bar (a
  dummy mouse move posted on `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN`; changelog 0.30, "fixed ~500
  ms pause when clicking the title bar during continuous redraw") and its own
  comment says the right-click menu's freeze is not cancelled. This is the
  case that matters most: a player who holds the window for 5 seconds was
  dropped.
- **macOS.** Winit's run-loop observers and its wake-up timer are added in
  the common run-loop modes (`platform_impl/macos/observer.rs`), which take in
  the event-tracking mode AppKit runs during a live resize, and `drawRect:`
  sends `RedrawRequested` at once (changelog 0.25, "emit RedrawRequested events
  immediately while the window is being resized"), so a live resize should
  keep the session turning. Whether moving the window by its title bar holds
  the loop is AppKit's behaviour, which the source cannot show: unconfirmed.
- **Linux**, X11 and Wayland: the window manager or the compositor moves and
  resizes the window, and nothing in winit holds the loop.
- **Everywhere:** a long frame, a mission load (`begin_session_flight` loads
  the aircraft and builds the scenery on the loop) and an input script's
  `shot` step (a blocking GPU read-back, then a PNG written on the loop).

So the fix matters most on Windows, and is built for every platform.

**The keepalive.** A game joined over UDP starts a small thread
(`tore_net::Keepalive`, driven by `net::session::KeptAlive`) once the host
accepts the join. It holds a clone of the game's own socket, so it speaks from
the connection's address, and the connection's Keepalive packet (kind 10,
nine bytes: the checksum, the kind and the connection id;
[protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#keepalive), protocol 5). Every turn of the
game's session tells it the loop has run.

- **Rate.** It sends nothing while the loop turns. Once the loop has not
  turned for 1 second it sends one keepalive, then one a second (it looks
  every 250 ms). The game's own transport sends at least 10 packets a second,
  so the thread only ever speaks in a stall.
- **The bound.** It sends none once the loop has not turned for 60 seconds,
  so a game that is truly hung is dropped as before, 5 seconds after its last
  keepalive, about 65 seconds into the stall.
- **Identity.** The packet carries the connection's id and is accepted only
  from the connection's address, exactly what a Payload needs, so nobody else
  can keep a connection alive and nothing new is open to a stranger. The host
  counts it as hearing from the connection (no acknowledgement, round trip
  or rate statistic) and never answers it; the first since the game's last
  Payload tells the session the game has stalled (`tore_net::Event::Stalled`),
  and the next Payload that it is back (`Event::Resumed`, with how long it
  was gone).
- **Lifetime.** The thread starts once the session is past joining, stops
  (and is joined) when the connection closes, a new one is started for a new
  connection, and dropping the session stops it. It only sends: it never
  reads the socket and never touches the client's state.
- **The King** joins over the in-process link and has no keepalive: the host
  exempts its connection from the timeout (EF4).
- **The log.** When the loop comes back the game's log says how many
  keepalives covered the stall ("Network: the game was held up; its
  keepalive kept the connection (14 keepalives, 14 in all)"). The host logs
  the stall at its first keepalive and its end at the first Payload after it
  (`HostLog::Stalled` and `Resumed`: "seat 2 Viper: game stalled, flying
  neutral", "seat 2 Viper: game back after 7.4 s"; a player in the lobby has
  no seat and flies nothing), in the dedicated server's log and in a hosting
  game's; a game stalled past the bound leaves with the usual "silent" line
  ([server guide](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#the-mission-lifecycle)).

**The stall rule: a stalled game counts as paused.** *The lead's application
(2026-10-01) of John's rule of 2026-09-30* that the controls go neutral while
a game is paused or in its Esc menu ([decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions)).
The host knows a seat's game is stalled once more than 60 ticks (half a
second) in a row have had no input from it (`host::inputs::STALL_TICKS`,
agent decision), or once it hears the connection's keepalives, whichever
comes first. From then on every tick with no input takes exactly the
controls a paused game sends (`Controls::neutral`): stick, rudder and
throttle rate centred, no throttle position so the throttle stays where it
was, the trigger released, no commands (the momentary ones are commands, and
a missing tick never repeats them), and the scope controls as they were. The
neutral controls fly that seat's plane only, and end at the first fresh
input. A late or lost input packet costs a few ticks and every packet
repeats the last 24, so below the threshold nothing changes: a late player's
last controls repeat as before. The network matrix, short and full, checks
that no seat is ever flown neutral on any of its paths
(`PlayerStatus::inputs_neutral` stays 0); in the simulator a seat that
stalls while pulling and firing fires on and pulls on for half a second and
then stops firing, its elevator back to 0 with the throttle unchanged
(`client/stall_tests.rs`). The King's own plane follows the same rule when
its window is held, though its connection never times out.

**What a 15-second stall looks like.**

- *For the stalled player:* the picture freezes. When it comes back, their
  plane is where the host flew it meanwhile: half a second on the last
  controls the host had, then neutral ([the stall rule](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k):
  a held trigger stops firing, a held pull stops pulling); the client takes
  the host's newest state instead of stepping the backlog (a catch-up), and
  everything else jumps to where it is now. Then, as the snapshots that waited
  in the socket and the first fresh ones are read, the own plane may be
  corrected a few times within about a fifth of a second (about eleven in each of
  three runs of the test since the stall rule, the largest seen about 7 ft
  and 6 degrees, most of them blended; up to 22 ft and 20 degrees before it,
  when the host still flew the held pull), and none after. Those come from the ticks between the state the client caught up to
  and the present, which it predicted with controls the host had already
  replaced with neutral ones.
- *For the others:* the player's plane flies on smoothly, half a second on
  its last controls and then hands off the stick with its throttle where it
  was; the player stays in the roster and the lobby, and nobody is told
  anything (the host's log is). Before EF-K the plane went back to the AI after 5 seconds and the
  player was gone.

**Measured** (`net/keepalive_tests.rs`, real time, a hosted game with its King
over the link and a guest over loopback UDP, both pumped once a 16 ms frame):
a guest stalled for 15 seconds sent 14 keepalives, was never dropped, caught
up once and had settled (two seconds with no correction) within 4 seconds of
coming back (in four runs), while the King had no correction during the stall, still held
the crown and both flew on; with the bound set to 3 seconds a stalled guest
sent 2 keepalives and was dropped as silent 7.2 seconds into its stall, and
learned it on coming back. A windowed run (release builds, the game joined
to `tore-server` on loopback, the machine building the workspace in release
for the first 50 seconds) took nine input-script `shot` steps 2 seconds
apart: seven of them held the game's loop long enough for keepalives (3 to 5
each, 26 in all, one stall past 5 seconds, which used to drop the player),
and the player was never dropped and left by its own Leave. The transport's own tests (`tore-net`'s
`tests/keepalive.rs`, on the simulator) keep a stall of 15 seconds, refuse a
keepalive from another address, with another id or of another version, and
check that the host answers none.

### Recordings and diagnostics

John decided on 2026-09-30 that in stage D a client does not record a mission
replay live (the recorder reads the host's AI and combat state, which a client
does not have). Instead each networked flight keeps:

- a **capture**: every packet the client received, with its arrival time, and
  every input it sent, in a file beside the replays, kept and pruned by the
  replays' own auto-delete rules. It is what the client knew, complete, so the
  client session can be run again from it offline, exactly;
- a **diagnostics log** (`logs/net-<date>.tsv` in the data folder): once a
  second the round trip, loss, snapshot arrival spread, input margin,
  interpolation delay, corrections made and bytes each way, plus every join,
  drop and refusal.

*Built (D8a)* in the client session: `Client::set_capture` writes the capture
([format](formats/net-protocol.md#captures)) and `capture::replay` runs it
again offline into the same frames; `Client::set_diagnostics` writes the log,
a header line and then tab-separated lines that start with the seconds and
the kind (`stats` once a second with the fields of
`client::diagnostics::STATS_FIELDS`, and `connect`, `joined`, `mission`,
`seated`, `seat-refused`, `content-refused`, `debrief`, `mission-ended`,
`refused` and `closed`). The game names the files and keeps them (D8b).

*Built (D8b, the files).* `net/files.rs` in the game holds both files'
bookkeeping; the client session writes into them. The log is a writer that
appends whole lines to `logs/net-<date>.tsv` (UTC date, a new file at
midnight, created when the first line arrives) and survives a failing disk by
dropping lines. The capture is created beside the replays as
`<date>_<time>_NET_<host>.tore-capture` (the server as typed, letters and
digits only; a clash adds `-2`). The replays' auto-delete rule prunes both
(agent decision): captures as a list of their own, so a run of networked
flights never pushes a replay out, and the logs as a list counted in days;
"keep the last N" means N captures and N days of logs, "older than D days"
reads the date from the name, and a file written in the last ten minutes, the
capture being written, or a file that does not have the right name and first
bytes is never removed.

In stage E a capture **converts into a replay** (John, 2026-09-30): every
aircraft follows a smooth curve through every update the client received,
using hindsight, instead of what the player saw live with its guesses ahead;
the own aircraft follows the host's states and the prediction between them;
events, radio and effects come from the host's events. The replay carries the
diagnostics. The dedicated server logs the same figures for every player.

#### Converting a capture into a replay

*Built (slice E-replay, `mp/capture-replay`). Everything here that John did
not say on 2026-09-30 is an agent decision.* The player-facing description is
[Network flights](REPLAYS.md#network-flights) in the replay guide.

**Where it runs.** The conversion lives in `tore_session::client::convert`
(it needs the client session, to decode what the capture holds, and it writes
with `tore-replay`, so `tore-session` takes that existing workspace crate as a
dependency). The game calls it in two places, both through
`replay/net_convert.rs`:

- **Automatically when a networked flight ends.** When the session is over
  and its capture file is closed (the session dropped), the game starts a
  background thread that converts the capture and logs the result (the
  replay's path, or why not). Only a session that flew converts, and only when
  the game keeps captures at all (`TORE_RECORD_MISSIONS=0` writes none).
  Nothing waits for it: the render thread has gone back to the menu, and the
  new replay shows in the Replays list the next time the screen opens. A game
  closed before the thread ends leaves the capture, which converts the next
  time you ask.
- **By hand, `--convert-capture CAPTURE [--out REPLAY]`.** Headless, needs only
  the import (the same data folder the game and `tore-bot` read). It converts
  old captures and gives the tests and the battery a way to run the
  conversion. `--out` is a new file, as `--recording-log` and
  `--recording-acmi` take theirs (agent decision: not a bare second argument);
  without it the replay goes beside the capture, named like any recording
  (`2026-10-05_1540_UKR_F18.tore-replay`: the date and time of the capture's
  name, the map and the player's aircraft, and a `-2` on a clash). A capture
  of several flights (the player left and joined again) gives one replay a
  flight (`-2`, `-3` after `--out`'s name).

```

The conversion runs twice over the data: first the client is run again from
the capture with an observer that keeps what the client was given
(`client/seen.rs`; a client with no observer pays for none of it), then one
replay frame is built for every host tick and handed to the writer as it is
made (a ten-minute flight with 30 aircraft is 72,000 frames, too many to hold).
Running the client again is the only way to decode the snapshots, whose
entries are coded against baselines, so the conversion needs the same import
the capture was made with, as `capture::replay` does. On the guide's mission
with real data (debug build) a 40-second flight converts in under 2 seconds,
and writes 150 KB.

**The smoothing** (`client/convert/smooth.rs`). The replay's tick range runs
from the first host tick a snapshot showed after the player was seated (before
it the client knows only its own plane) to the newest host tick any snapshot
reached; nothing is shown beyond what the host said.

- *Other aircraft, missiles, debris and ejected pilots.* Each keeps every
  state any snapshot carried for it (the quantized position and velocity, and
  the rest of the record). The frame at tick *t* lies on a cubic Hermite curve
  through the two states either side of *t*, using their positions and
  velocities, as the live client draws between two snapshots, but with
  hindsight: the live client had no state after its newest and so went on
  along the last velocity for up to 250 ms, and drew an entity the host sends
  4 times a second a whole interval late. The replay never guesses ahead: it
  draws such an entity exactly between its two updates, at the time they say.
  The code is the live interpolator's own (`Interpolator`'s `between`), so a
  state is turned into a pose the way live flight does: attitudes turn the
  short way (`Basis::blended`), devices and velocity blend, and the stepped
  fields (engine, damage, flags, wreck phase) keep the earlier state's value
  until the later state's tick. At a state's own tick the curve gives that
  state, so the path passes through every received sample and is exact there
  (the wire's steps are the replay's finer ones).
- *Gaps.* A lost snapshot just widens the span between two states. A span of
  more than 2 seconds (240 ticks) is not bridged: the entity is left out of
  the frames in between, since a curve that long says nothing. An entity
  appears at its first state and ends at its last, so a slow entity shows up
  to half a second after the player would first have seen it live.
- *The slow entities (2 Hz).* The same curve over a 60-tick span. A far
  aircraft's position between two of its updates is therefore a smooth curve
  rather than a hold, and the curve is as good as its two velocities.
- *The own aircraft* (`Own`). The host sends an exact state of the plane once a
  second and whenever the client's prediction differed from its hashes; between
  them the client flew the plane itself. The predictor keeps a trace of every
  tick it stepped and every exact state it was given (`Predictor::trace_on`,
  off in the game). The replay takes the host's exact state at each of its
  ticks, and between two exact states the prediction as the client stepped it
  from the earlier one (a correction re-steps the ticks after it, and the
  trace's later write for a tick wins). When the prediction was wrong (the next
  exact state is not where it ended up), the difference is spread back over the
  span: the predicted path plus a share of the error that grows linearly from
  none at the earlier exact state to all of it at the later one. The result is
  smooth and equals the host's state at every exact state's tick; a flight
  with no corrections is simply the prediction. A tick nobody predicted (the
  host's state came for a tick far ahead) lies on a curve between its
  neighbours. No second simulation runs. Flight data the host does not send for
  other aircraft is written as the format's nominal values (1 G, no fuel, idle
  controls, the speed device or the ground speed for airspeed) and is not shown
  for them; the own aircraft's come from the predicted flight.
- *Which plane is the player* (John, 2026-10-05; slice F2-O2 built it). Every
  plane keeps its real id in the frames, the events and the roster. The
  header's `draw.player` and `net.player_plane` name the plane the seat flew
  (neither is written for plane 0, the usual first seat, so those replays are
  as they were), the roster's `You` is that plane, and the viewer follows
  `draw.player` as it follows it in a single-player recording of another seat
  (the replay guide's [limit](REPLAYS.md#whose-flight-it-is), now ended). The
  conversion used to swap the player's id with plane 0's so that a viewer that
  looked for the player under id 0 found it; the swap and its tests are gone
  (the seat's HUD lines, order calls and release sounds are subject
  `draw.player`, and `draw.slots` reaches the highest plane other than the
  player's).
- *Events, radio and effects.* They come from the host's events and effects
  only, each on the tick the host gave (an event outside the replay's ticks is
  left out): HUD lines (`comms.hud`), radio, crew and tower lines with their
  recordings' names (`comms.radio`, `comms.crew`, `comms.tower`, heard once),
  the player's order voice, weapon release sounds, launches, chaff and flare
  releases (`combat.countermeasure` with the exact release geometry the host
  sent), explosions, hits and ground strikes (effect spawns), craters and
  crash-site fires, ground objects destroyed, wingmen ejecting and the host's
  gun bursts (`weapon.gun_burst`, new). Rumble, the weapon page, an order's
  answer, the player's own explosion and sound emissions are not kept (the
  aircraft's state and the effects say the same). Smoke, contrails and
  gun rounds are not sent, so the game makes them again, as the live client
  does ([below](#smoke-contrails-and-gun-rounds-in-a-converted-replay-slice-e2)).
  The cockpit readout, radar contacts and the HUD are not part of a replay.

**What carries the diagnostics.** The replay format does not change, and the
version stays 1 (new data arrives as new events, header entries and result
entries, which a reader that does not know them ignores, the format's own rule):

- `net.stats`, an event once a second on the host tick the client was
  drawing then, with the diagnostics log's `stats` fields as numbers (round
  trip, loss, snapshot loss and spread, input margin, interpolation delay,
  clock rate, corrections, mismatches, extrapolated entities, bytes each way,
  predicted and render tick);
- `net.event`, an event for every other diagnostics line (a join, seating,
  refusal, mission, debrief, drop), with the line's kind in its `kind` field
  and the rest as its text;
- the header holds the connection (`net.server`, `net.callsign`,
  `net.build`, `net.capture` with the capture's own format and protocol
  version, `net.flight`) and the footer's result holds the flight's summary
  (`net.seconds`, `net.rtt_ms_mean`, `net.rtt_ms_max`, `net.loss_percent_mean`,
  `net.snapshot_loss_percent_mean`, `net.corrections`, `net.mismatches`),
  which the Replays screen reads without decoding a frame.

The conversion's replayed client writes the diagnostics lines itself (the same
`Diagnostics` writer), and a test finds them equal to the log the client wrote
live, apart from the header line, so the replay carries exactly the figures
the player's log has.

**A cut capture.** A capture that ends in the middle of a record, or whose
session never ended (the game closed or crashed), converts up to its last whole
record. The replay's footer says `end=cut` and `capture=cut short at byte N of M`
with the seconds converted, the command prints the same, and a capture with no
seated flight in it (a join that never reached a mission) gives no replay and
says why.

**Repeatable.** Converting a capture twice gives the same bytes (a test, and
the battery scenario's `--out` pair): nothing in the conversion reads the clock,
the system or an unordered map. The header's recording time comes from the
capture's file name (empty when the name is not the game's), the game version
and commit are the converting game's, the connection's build is `net.build`,
and the platform string the live recorder writes is left out, since a flight
is the same wherever it is converted.

**A join through the master (slice J2) and the relay (J5).** A capture of a
join through the master has a Race record (kind 10) right after the start; the
conversion runs the client from it like any other record, so a raced capture
converts the same as a direct one, and the replay's `net.server` is the address
the capture's start names. When the race finds nothing and the relay's channel
opens, the game and `tore-bot` start a new client for the relayed address and
a new capture (the race's capture, which holds no game, is removed in the game
and truncated by the bot's new file). The conversion therefore only ever sees
the capture of the connection that flew; a game that converts the capture of a
session that never flew (no snapshots) gets no replay, as before.

**How the Replays screen shows it.** A converted replay is an ordinary
recording to the list: it sorts by the capture's start and has the theater,
the player's aircraft and the length; its mission reads "Network flight". Its
details panel adds a **Network** row (the server as typed, the mean round trip
and the mean loss) from the header and the footer. The viewer plays it with its
controls, views, sound for the host's radio lines, and export. The replays'
auto-delete rule counts a converted replay with the other replays, and the
capture it came from as before (captures are a list of their own).

**Tests** (agent decisions on what to check). `client/convert_tests.rs`: a
bot fight (two bots, 150 ms, 2 percent loss) converts; the replay decodes with
no problem; every aircraft's path passes through every received state within
1/64 ft and takes no step larger than its speed allows (1.5 times the faster
end's speed, or the distance the two states are apart, plus a tenth of a foot);
the own aircraft equals the host's state at every exact state (and the host's
own world); the diagnostics read back and equal the live log; converting twice
gives the same bytes; a capture of a raced join (a Race record after the start)
converts like a direct one; a cut capture converts, says so, and one cut before
seating gives no flight; and, on states made by hand, the curve stops at the
first and last state and does not bridge a long silence, the correction is
spread back exactly, and the host's events become the replay's. `replay/net_convert.rs`
(the game): the names, `--out`, a refusal to overwrite, the cut report, the
viewer's own `Playback` drawing the converted replay's player and the three
others at every tested tick, the debug log and Tacview export, and the
session's mapping of an aircraft against the game recorder's. Battery (the `net` lane):
`net-convert-capture` flies a real `tore-server` with `tore-bot
--capture`, converts, reads the replay back, converts twice for the same bytes
and converts a cut copy.

#### Smoke, contrails and gun rounds in a converted replay (slice E2)

*Built (E2, 2026-10-05, `mp/e2-effects`). John asked on 2026-10-05 for a
replay converted from a capture to show smoke, contrails and gun rounds,
regenerated as the live client does; everything below that is not that
sentence is an agent decision.* The host sends none of the three. A live
client makes them again from the picture it draws ([the client
session](#the-client-session)); the conversion does the same over the frames
it builds, tick by tick, and writes the result the way a single-player
recording carries it: puffs in the frame's spawns, gun rounds as projectiles of
the gun's weapon. The viewer then rebuilds them from the recording like any
other, with no new code and no new format (the version stays 1).

**Where it runs.** The conversion (`tore-session`) cannot make them: it has
no drawn aircraft model (the contrails start at each type's engine outlets,
which come from the model) and no renderer's helpers. So it hands every frame,
built and complete, to a `Regenerate` the caller gives
(`Conversion::write_with`; `write` gives it nothing). The game's is
`NetEffects` (`replay/net_effects.rs`), which `replay/net_convert.rs` builds
for each flight. It is a pure function of the frames it is given, so
converting twice gives the same bytes.

  guns --> rounds["frame.projectiles<br/>(the gun's weapon)"]
```

- *Smoke and contrails* are `regen::Effects`, the live client's own, stepped
  once per host tick over the picture the viewer's decoder
  (`convert::snapshot`) makes of the frame: motor smoke while a missile's motor
  burns (the motor read from the weapon record, dated from the tick the
  missile first appears), damage smoke from an aircraft at half its hit
  points or less, crash-site columns over the fires the host's marks started,
  and contrails above each aircraft's onset altitude. The puffs released on a
  tick are written as that frame's `new_puffs`, as the single-player recorder
  lists them (oldest first, smoke then contrails).
- *Engine outlets* come from the drawn model, which is loaded
  (`Airframe::load`) the first time an aircraft of that type is high enough to
  leave a contrail, so a flight that never climbs that high loads none. A model
  that does not load leaves no contrails for that type, with a warning in the
  log.
- *Gun rounds* are `net::guns::Guns`, the live client's own, given the host's
  gun burst events of each frame (the player's own too: a replay has no
  trigger, so every burst, whoever fired it, makes its rounds, where the live
  client draws its own from its trigger). A round is made and flown with the
  simulation's rules, from the shooter's pose at the tick it left, on the
  gun's cadence and with the tracer on every third. It is written as a
  projectile of the gun's weapon (registered as a `Gun` when the first round
  needs it), with a number that stays with the round for its whole flight (the
  live client numbers rounds by their place in a list; a recording needs a
  round to keep its identity so the viewer can blend it between ticks), owner
  its shooter and age the ticks since it left. A closed burst is known whole
  from its first tick, since the conversion has hindsight.
- *Known differences from the host*, as in the live client: a round's line
  differs from the host's within the gun's cone (the host's spread seed is
  not sent), a missile's smoke can start a tick or two off the host's, and a
  burst or a missile that began before the replay's first tick is not there.
  A flight that fills the format's per-tick limits (4,096 puffs, 1,024
  projectiles) drops the extras.
- *The report.* `--convert-capture` and the game's log say what was made
  ("Made again: N smoke puffs, M contrail puffs, K gun rounds").

**Tests.** `replay/net_effects.rs`: a bot fight at 40,000 feet converts with
contrails from the engines (60 to 85 puffs a second for four aircraft with two
outlets each, which is combat's ten puffs a second per outlet), and the
viewer's `Playback` rebuilds them; a low flight has none, and an import whose
model cannot load still converts; the gun bursts of a fight become exactly the
rounds the gun's cadence gives (every closed burst counted), each alive on
every tick between its first and its last, with one shooter and a stable
number, a third of them tracers, drawn by the viewer as gun rounds; hand-made
frames give damage smoke, crash-site columns and missile smoke; converting
twice gives the same bytes; a gun the weapon registry has not named gets its
own id once. `replay/net_convert.rs`: the game's conversion carries rounds,
says so in its report and gives the same bytes twice. Battery (`net` lane):
`net-convert-capture` now flies the capture at 40,000 feet and checks that the
conversion made contrails, motor smoke when the host sent launches, and gun
rounds when it sent bursts (also in the Tacview export with `--guns`); the
bots rarely fire the gun there, so the gun half of that check is the Rust
tests' (see the ledger).

### How stage D lands

Slices, each on its own `mp/d-<topic>` branch and worktree, merged by the lead
with the quick check per change and the check list plus the single-player
baseline at merge. "Opus" slices are networking, concurrency, determinism or
risky refactors, as John asked; the rest are Sonnet.

| Slice | Branch | Model | After | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 Codec | `mp/d-codec` | Sonnet | | `tore-codec`: bits, variable-length integers, quantizers, FNV-1a, CRC-32 | Round trips at every width; a bounded reader never panics on 100,000 seeded random inputs; known CRC-32 and FNV-1a test vectors. **Built (D1):** also the bucketed signed coding, exact floats against a baseline and short strings; the readers reject every non-canonical form |
| D2 Transport | `mp/d-net` | Opus | D1 | `tore-net`: packets, handshake, acks and round trip, reliable ordered messages, statistics, UDP and the simulator | On the simulator at 300 ms and 5 percent loss with duplicates and reordering: the handshake completes, 10,000 reliable messages arrive once and in order, a 64 KB message arrives whole, the round trip estimate is within 5 percent and the loss estimate within 1 point; a challenge is never larger than its request; a seeded packet fuzz never panics; two real sockets on 127.0.0.1 connect. **Built (D2):** 10,000 messages each way and 64 KB arrive in 25 simulated seconds; the round trip reads 286 to 306 ms across 20 seeds, mostly a little low under reordering; the loss estimate equals the loss over the packets it judged, 4.6 and 5.7 percent over the run; the fuzz reaches bad-packet and protocol-error endings; IPv6 loopback works too. [Wire details the build settled](formats/net-protocol.md#what-the-transport-settled) |

| D3b Mission as data | `mp/d-mission` | Sonnet | D3a | **Built (D3b).** `MissionSpec` and its text form; `World::new` with single-player seating; the creator builds through it | Single-player baseline SAME; the spec round-trips through text; a headless test builds a single-player mission from synthetic resources and steps it |
| D4 Own-plane step and exact state | `mp/d-own-state` | Opus | D1 | The shared per-plane step; an exact coder and hash for a human plane's flight, turbulence and ownship terms, every field destructured | Single-player baseline SAME; a plane stepped by `World` and a copy stepped by the shared function from a decoded state, with the same inputs and terms, stay bit-identical for 1,200 ticks; adding a field to the state without coding it fails to compile. **Built (D4):** see [one step for a human's plane](#one-step-for-a-humans-plane) and [its exact state](#the-exact-state-of-a-humans-plane); an airborne plane's exact state costs about 200 bytes against a baseline one snapshot back |
| D5a Flight frame | `mp/d-frame` | Sonnet | D3b | The flight frame with its plane id; the screens, views and sounds read it; no "aircraft 0 is the player" in presentation; the picture for any seat | Single-player baseline SAME and every GPU capture byte-identical; a test builds the picture for a second seat of the crowd fixture with that seat's plane as the player. **Built (D5a):** see [the flight screen draws a frame](#the-flight-screen-draws-a-frame) |
| D5b Cockpit readout | `mp/d-readout` | Sonnet | D5a | The cockpit readout and its builder; the HUD, weapon HUD, scope, RWR, target window, map and music read it | Single-player baseline SAME and every capture byte-identical; readouts for two seats of the crowd fixture each name their own plane's stores, contacts and damage. **Built (D5b):** see [the flight screen draws a frame](#the-flight-screen-draws-a-frame) |
| D3c Open seating | `mp/d-open` | Opus | D5a | `Seating::Open`: plane 0 on the AI, a tick with no human, combat with no ownship | Single-player baseline SAME; a headless test builds an open mission with every plane on the AI, steps it 1,200 ticks, then a seat takes plane 0, flies, and gives it back. **Built (D3c):** see [open seating and no human](#a-mission-with-no-window); the run repeats to the bit, and two seats hand planes in both wings through a fight, the last leaving the mission with no human |
| D6 Wire | `mp/d-wire` | Opus | D1, D3b, D4, D5b | `tore-session`'s messages: inputs, snapshots with acknowledged baselines, priorities and relevance, own-state hash and exact state, readouts, events (bursts and launches included), join messages, debrief | Every message round-trips; a snapshot decodes with any earlier packet lost; entities always get their share of the packet; a wire golden test fails when the bytes change without a protocol version bump; bytes per snapshot measured on the 15 against 15 mission against the [budget](multiplayer-plan.md#bandwidth-budget). **Built (D6):** seeded round trips of every section and message; a 3,000-snapshot run dropping, duplicating and reordering packets and acknowledgements rebuilds every entity exactly; 100,000 fuzzed bodies; the golden copy `crates/tore-session/wire-golden.txt`. On the 15 against 15 mission (29 other aircraft, up to 31 missiles in flight) the Snapshot section is 177 to 879 bytes, mean 350, before the readout; the readout's record is 4 to 506 bytes, mean 52, against a plain size of mean 1,895; the whole download is 13.2 KB/s before the messages ([details](formats/net-protocol.md#what-the-games-sections-settled)) |

The server ran the guide's mission with real data at 6 to 7 ms a tick in a debug build (not measured in release) |
| D8 Client, bot and `--connect` | `mp/d-client` | Opus | D5b, D6, D7 | The client session: join, prediction, reconciliation, smoothing, interpolation (the slow entities' longer delay included), clock steering, local effects, neutral controls in menus; the headless bot (the client session with a scripted pilot); the game's `--connect`; the capture and the diagnostics log | On the simulator with no loss, one platform and no hit, the prediction never differs from the host; two bots fly a 5-minute fight against a server; a windowed client flies against a server on this machine through `tools/agent-run.sh`. **Client half built (D8a):** [the client session](#the-client-session) with the bot, the capture and the diagnostics log, headless; the game's `--connect` is D8b **Game half built (D8b):** `--connect` joins a server and flies it on the flight screen (the options and their checks, the session's turn, the frame the screen draws, the events presented, the regenerated smoke, contrails, chaff and flares, the session rules, the diagnostics and capture files with their pruning, End Mission and the debrief). **Gun rounds built (D8c):** see [the client session](#the-client-session). A windowed game flew three minutes against a `tore-server` beside a `tore-bot`, ended the mission and read its debrief |
| D9 Lag compensation | `mp/d-lagcomp` | Opus | D4 | The hit-volume history in combat, the view tick in `SeatInput`, rewound gun hit tests | Single-player baseline SAME; a burst aimed at the drawn position of a target crossing at 500 knots, with a 150 ms round trip and a 100 ms interpolation delay, hits with compensation and misses without; the cap holds. **Built (D9):** see [hits and lag compensation](#hits-and-lag-compensation); missiles fired by the same seat carry no rewind |
| D10 Matrix and measurements | `mp/d-matrix` | Sonnet | D8, D9 | The simulator matrix as a test, a CI job with a host and two bots, load and bandwidth at 2, 8, 15 and 30 humans | The [matrix limits](MULTIPLAYER.md#netcode-numbers) hold; CI passes on all three platforms; `docs/baselines/net-<date>.md` records the matrix, bandwidth against the budget and host CPU per human. **Built (D10):** the matrix is `client/matrix_tests.rs` in `tore-session`: nine cells (50, 150 and 300 ms against 0, 2 and 5 percent loss each way, 1 percent duplicates, arrivals spread by 10 percent) of a host and two bots on the synthetic fixtures, each judged on every limit of the acceptance table for each bot, the short form (60 simulated seconds a cell) in the normal suite and the five minutes an ignored test; every limit holds in every cell. The CI job (`.github/workflows/network.yml`, on Linux, Windows and macOS runners; only the Linux run has been seen) runs `tests/loopback.rs`: the host in the test process and two real `tore-bot` processes over loopback UDP with a synthetic import. Host cost and bandwidth with real data come from `tests/host_players.rs` (host processor time with 0, 2, 8, 15 and 30 bots on a 15 against 15 mission) and are in the [baseline](baselines/net-2026-09-30.md); the host change is that exact states wait for the Seated message's acknowledgement ([host session](#the-host-session)) |

The host's default rate (`HostConfig`, `tore-server`'s `snapshot-rate`), the far band's weight (`wire/priority.rs`), the client's far interval (`client/interpolation.rs`), the upload need (`succession::need_per_player`), and every test and measurement that assumed 30 or 2 | The session tests at the new defaults; the bandwidth, host cost, matrix, standby and observer figures before and after, measured the same day; docs at the new rates **Built (D12, 2026-10-06):** no wire change; protocol 15 (the lead: no byte changes, and both ends are the same build). `HostConfig::new` and `tore-server` default to `DEFAULT_SNAPSHOT_RATE` 60; the setting keeps 10 to 60. The far band adds `FAR_RATE` 4 a snapshot, never more than the rate, and starts again from nothing when sent, so a far entity goes every `far_snapshots` snapshots, the rate over 4 rounded up: 4 a second at 60, 40, 24, 20 and 12, 3.75 at 30 and 15, 3.33 at 10, evenly spaced (*agent decision*: rounded up so it stays even and never over 4). Both ends work it out from the Accepted packet's ticks per snapshot ([the table](formats/net-protocol.md#connecting)). The client draws a far entity `far_interval_ticks` back before its gaps are known (30 ticks at 60, 60 before), and takes an entity for far when a gap is at least 4 snapshots, or the far interval when that is fewer (10 and 12 a second), and at least half the far interval (8 snapshots at 60), so a near one losing up to 6 snapshots in a row at 60 stays near (`far_gap_snapshots`, *agent decision*). Each other player's upload need is 28 KB/s scaled by the rate over 30, 56 KB/s at 60 (*agent decision*: scaled, not fitted). Found and left as they were, each checked: lag compensation's rewind uses the seat's own reported interpolation delay, so it follows the rate; the input margin and the inputs' 60 packets a second do not depend on it; the interpolation delay still adapts between 50 and 250 ms (on loopback the bots sit at its floor, 54 ms, at both rates, so 60 a second brings other aircraft no nearer the present; a lower floor is a possible follow-up); a snapshot's 1,200 bytes and the 256 kept for messages are per packet and fit as before; baselines count snapshots back, at most 31, so at 60 a second a baseline older than about half a second (a round trip over about 500 ms) is sent in full; the standby stream's ticks still go once a snapshot interval, 6 to 9 percent more bytes (*agent decision*: kept); the observer delay's ring keeps a frame each snapshot interval, twice the memory (*agent decision*: kept); the matrix's download budget is 44 KB/s. Tests: `priority.rs` (the far interval at every rate as the accumulator spaces it), `interpolation.rs` (the far band at five rates, a near entity losing snapshots), `host/tests.rs` (each seat's phase at 60 and at 30), `observe_tests.rs`, `succession_tests.rs` (the need at four rates, the throttled-link test at the new need), the config defaults in both crates. Measured ([baseline](baselines/net-rates-2026-10-06.md)): a snapshot is the same size at both rates, so a player's download doubles (11.7 to 23.4 KB/s in the packet test); the host's upload with 15 players 1.50 to 2.63 Mbit/s (busiest second 4.4 to 8.2), with 30 players 3.58 to 6.31 Mbit/s (8.5 to 14.2); the host's cost with 30 players 2.5 to 3.4 ms a tick, 41 percent of one core; every matrix limit holds. `tests/bandwidth.rs` codes both rates side by side and `tests/host_players.rs` takes `TORE_MEASURE_RATE` |

## Lobby and hosting

Design for stages E and F of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
taken together at John's request of 2026-10-01, written by the lead and
reviewed by John the same day; his answers are in the guide's
[decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions). Built so far: slice EF0, the research
and the dialog reader, slice EF1, the import of the art, slice EF2, the widget
kit, slice EF3, the host inside the game, slice EF4, the lobby on the wire,
slice EF5, discovery and addresses, slice EF6, chat, slice EF7, the Direct
Connection screen, and slice EF8, the lobby screen (below); the rest is
design.
Every choice is an agent decision unless it is credited to John.

John's direction (2026-10-01):

- A player hosts a game from inside the game and builds its mission with the
  Quick Mission creator.
- The menus reuse retail backgrounds and pieces, not necessarily retail's
  layouts: for the first mode, the MODEM CONNECTION background with the
  TCP/IP Network connection panel, retail buttons and other pieces.
- The first mode is a direct, unpublished lobby for friends: the game lists
  games broadcast on the local network and connects directly to an IP address
  or a domain name. A public lobby through the master server is stage I.
- Chat in the lobby and in flight.
- He tests "the whole shebang" together on his three machines; there is no
  separate command-line test of stage D.

In short:

- The hosting player's game runs the stage D host on a thread of its own, and
  flies its own aircraft as a client of that host over an in-process link, so a
  hosted game is presented exactly like a joined one and a stalled window never
  stalls the mission.
- A new **Direct Connection** screen finds games on the local network and
  joins one, or an address. **New** opens a **lobby**: the King builds the
  mission with the creator, players pick slots, arm their aircraft, chat, say
  they are ready, and the King starts. After the mission everyone returns to
  the lobby.
- Chat runs through the host with retail's receivers, in the lobby's message
  box and on a line in flight opened with `~`.
- Single player does not change.

### Surveys behind the design

Three read-only surveys of 2026-10-01 (in the lead's local notes); the first
is now the spec:

- **Retail art.** Settled in EF0 and written down in the
  [multiplayer spec](spec/multiplayer.md#retail-connection-screens) (what the
  player sees, with the rectangles, fonts, strings and `CHAT.TXT`) and the
  [menu format notes](formats/menu.md#multiplayer-connection-screens-dlg-records-panels-and-widget-pieces-ef0-2026-10-01)
  (the dialog records, the panel recipe and the widget pieces). In short: the
  NETWORK CONNECTION screen is `NETIPX3.PIC` plus a panel the game draws from
  `PANEL.PIC` and six `EDGE*.PIC` pieces plus `NEWNET.DLG`'s controls; MODEM
  CONNECTION is `MODEM3.PIC` with its panel baked in. The lobby's host and
  joiner dialogs are `NETNEW.DLG` and `NETJOIN.DLG`, the options panels
  `NETTCP.DLG` and `NETIPX2.DLG`, the message prompt `NETCEDT.DLG`; `MPSTATUS.PIC`
  and `MPFONT.PIC` are the connected-state status window of the menus (upper
  right), not the in-flight pane. The widget pieces are `EDITL/M/R` (typed in
  `WHEELFNT`, which the import also needs; the screens do not use them, see
  [the look](#finding-a-game-and-joining)), `LISTLFT/MID/RT/HI`, `PAGEBOX` and
  `CHECK00-06`; panel text is `PANELFNT`, list rows and the page counter
  `SMLFONT`, buttons `FONTACT` and `FONTDFT`. `CHAT.TXT` lies loose in the
  install. The import kept almost none of this before EF1 (about 40 names, with
  `WHEELFNT`; it keeps them now, see the EF1 row), and the 1.0 and 1.02F copies are
  byte-identical.
- **Menus.** There is no widget toolkit: each screen draws into the 640 by 480
  canvas with its own hit areas. Reusable today: the retail action buttons with
  the striped default cap, the PREV/NEXT rocker, the creator's paged list and
  bolted panel, two text fields (the controls search and the first-run path).
  There is no scrolling message box, no retail check box, no list built from the
  `LIST` pieces. The MULTI menu holds three "coming soon" rows. The creator
  produces a `MissionSpec`; its Fly passes through Load Ordnance into
  `build_mission`.
- **Hosting and chat.** `Host`, `World` and the transport can move to a thread
  as they are. Every seat is a network connection; there is no local seat. The
  host has no lobby phase (the first Ready starts the mission and everyone is
  disconnected at its end), no discovery and no chat. Flight's HUD shows seven
  message lines for five seconds each; `~` is unbound in flight.

### The host inside the game (stage E)

When a player presses New, the game starts a `tore_session::Host` on a thread
of its own with its own fixed 120 Hz clock and its UDP socket on the game port,
exactly as the dedicated server runs it. The hosting player's own game then
joins that host as a client, over an **in-process link** (a pair of queues that
implement the transport's datagram trait, no socket and no delay), and flies
through the same client session and screens a remote player uses.

*Agent decision:* this is the plan's stage E with one change. The plan had the
host's seat "fed directly" and the renderer reading the host's snapshots; a
local client gives the same zero-delay flight (its prediction matches the host
exactly on one machine, so nothing is ever corrected) with no second code path
for the host's screens. It costs one more copy of the mission's static data and
the own plane's prediction, both small.

- The host thread owns the `World` and never waits for the window: dragging,
  minimizing or a long frame on the hosting machine does not stall anyone.
- The thread stops when the host leaves or quits, telling every player; a
  panic on it ends the session for everyone with a plain message.
- On Windows the thread sleeps to just before each tick and finishes with a
  short spin, as the dedicated server does.
- A hosted game records the same capture and diagnostics as a joined one.

*Built (EF3)*, each an agent decision. The game hosts from the command line,
`tore-app --host MISSION_FILE`
([hosting from the game](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#hosting-from-the-game)), and
since EF7 and EF8 from its menus (New on Direct Connection opens a lobby).

- **The pieces.** The thread is `HostThread` in
  `crates/tore-app/src/net/hosting.rs`. `NetSession` (`net/session.rs`) runs
  over a `Transport`, a UDP socket or the link, and holds the thread when it
  hosts, so ending the session stops the host. The link is `tore_net::link`;
  the dual-stack `ServerSocket` and the sleep-then-spin `wait_until` moved
  from `tore-server` to `tore-net` unchanged, and the dedicated server and the
  host thread share them.
- **The link.** Two ends behind the transport's `Datagrams` trait, a locked
  queue each way of at most 1,024 datagrams; a full queue, or an end that is
  gone, drops the send, as a network would. The host's transport is
  `Linked<ServerSocket>`: the link is read first, then the socket. Datagrams
  from the link come from the reserved address `[100::]:0`, in the IPv6
  discard-only prefix and on port 0, which no UDP sender can have, and a
  datagram from the socket that claims it is dropped. The handshake treats it
  as any address: its own rate-limit budget, its own cookies, and an answer
  never larger than its request (a test joins over the link beside a remote
  client with no rate limiting and no cookie failure).
- **The thread** (`tore-host`, an 8 MiB stack like a main thread's). The game
  binds the socket itself, so a port in use is refused at once, then the
  thread builds the `Host` and runs the dedicated server's loop: receive,
  update, transmit, then wait until the next wake or 4 ms, whichever is
  sooner, sleeping and then spinning the last 0.4 ms (2 ms on Windows). The
  game's client starts joining at once; its first handshake packets wait in
  the link until the host is built (a client retries for 10 seconds).
- **Commands and reports.** In: `Stop`. *EF4:* the lobby's verbs are not
  commands: the hosting player's own connection is the King, so they go over
  that connection as the King's messages, as a remote King's would. Out:
  `Started` (aircraft, capacity), every `HostLog` entry (joins, refusals,
  seats, departures, the mission's start and end, overloads, faults), the
  `Phase` when its kind changes, `Note` for a socket error, and `Ended` with
  why: stopped, finished (the mission ended), the build failed, or a panic.
  The game reads them once a frame in `NetSession::pump` and writes each to
  its log after `Host:`.
- **Stopping.** `Stop` is the hosting player leaving the game
  (`Host::host_left`, EF4; EF3 used the console's `end`): a flying mission
  ends for every player with "Mission ended" (the host left the game) and
  their debrief, every player gets a Goodbye saying the host left and is
  disconnected once that is acknowledged, and the host stops when all are
  gone, or after 1.5 seconds disconnects the rest with "server stopping". The
  thread closes its socket before it reports its end; the game waits at most
  3 seconds for it. Quitting disconnects the hosting player's client and
  drops the session; the host takes the King's departure as the host
  leaving too. A game that loses its end of the channels stops the thread
  the same way. The hosting player's own connection is never dropped for
  silence ([below](#the-lobby)).
- **The panic rule.** A panic on the thread is caught. The thread tries once,
  itself guarded, to disconnect everyone with "server stopping" and send it,
  closes the socket and reports the panic; the hosting player's session ends
  with "The game you were hosting stopped: ..." on the main menu. A remote
  player that disconnect does not reach sees the client's timeout message.
  The game's panic hook still writes its fatal report, since the panic is a
  bug. Tests make the thread panic with a test-only command.
- **Measured** (the tests, synthetic import, debug build, this machine): a 30
  second hosted flight with a remote bot made no correction of the hosting
  player's plane at all and no hash mismatch. In a 2 second stall of the game
  side the host stepped exactly 240 ticks and the remote bot's longest gap
  between snapshots was 34 ms, one snapshot interval. After the stall the
  hosting player's plane was corrected at every snapshot for about 2 seconds
  (60 corrections, all adoptions of a state 4 ticks ahead of the prediction,
  while the client's input clock recovered) and never after. Leave and quit
  ended the host in 16 to 33 ms with a loopback guest; a panic was reported in
  10 ms. A windowed run (release build, 1280 by 960, a 12-aircraft mission
  with a `tore-bot` joined) hosted, flew, left with the debrief and stopped
  the host, and the bot was told. Hosting and joining the same mission cost
  the same per frame within the runs' noise (simulation and cameras 2.15 ms a
  frame hosting in both runs, against 2.20 and 2.33 ms joining a dedicated
  server; 9,000 frames each), and the hosting game held about 4 MB more at its
  peak (589 MB against 585 MB): the host's copy of the mission shares the
  game's import, so it is small.

### Finding a game and joining

The **Direct Connection** screen replaces the MULTI menu's stubs:

| Element | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Callsign | The player's callsign, remembered between sessions |
| Games | Games found on the local network, paged with PREV/NEXT and "PAGE n of m": name, mission (theater, aircraft), players and capacity, a lock when it has a password, and whether it is in the lobby or flying |
| Players | The players of the selected game, with the King's crown |
| Messages | What the screen is doing: searching, found, joining, refused and why |
| Connect to | An address or a domain name, with an optional port; the last few are remembered |
| New | Host a game: start the host and open its lobby as King |
| Join | Join the selected game, or the address typed |
| Options | Port, password to send, the game name, "Forward the game port on my router" (J4b), "Let my game take over hosting" (K7b), the quick messages |
| Cancel | Back to Choose Activity |

The look (John, 2026-10-05; from 2026-10-01 it was `MODEM3`'s red photograph
under `NETIPX3`'s title bar): `NETIPX3` alone, its grey photograph under its
own title bar, which reads DIRECT NETWORK CONNECTION: the retail lettering is
covered with a copy of the bar's own texture and the shipped lettering,
`assets/direct-network-connection-title.png` (the words in Liberation Sans with
a shadow, on a transparent background, no retail pixels), is drawn over it at
the top right. A
`DirectNetworkConnection.png` of the player's own in the data folder is drawn
there instead (see `widgets/header.rs`, read by `widgets/png_read.rs`, a small
PNG reader with no dependency; that file is never in the repository or a
package if it carries retail art). The look continues with the TCP/IP Network
connection panel at
retail's size and place, drawn from the panel pieces, with retail's buttons,
list wells, rocker and page box. The full-size panel covers most of the
photograph, which shows at its edges and between the bar and the panel.
*John, 2026-10-01, after seeing the first renders:* every text field is a
plain grey recessed box (NEWNET's Callsign look) and not retail's red edit
control.

**Local discovery.** While the screen is open the game sends a small query to
the local network's broadcast address on the game port every two seconds. Any
host on that port, player-hosted or dedicated, answers the sender with its
game's summary. The query and answer are two new packet kinds under the
version-free hello id, so a different build still shows up, marked as a
different version; the answer is never longer than the query, as the
handshake already requires. IPv4 broadcast only: IPv6 discovery, port mapping
and the internet are stage J. *Agent decision.*

*Built (EF5); EF7 draws it, [below](#the-direct-connection-screen-as-built-ef7).* What the screen takes:

- **The packets** are `tore_net::packet` kinds 8 (Discover query, exactly 1,000
  bytes: the asker's protocol version, a nonce, zero padding) and 9 (Discover
  answer: the nonce, the host's protocol version, flags, players, capacity, the
  session id, the game's version and commit, the name, the mission summary, the
  King and the callsigns as far as they fit), layouts in the
  [wire protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#discovery). They use the `TORE-HELLO`
  id and so sit outside the protocol version: `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is unchanged
  and the encodings have a golden file of their own, `crates/tore-net/
  discover-golden.txt`, so this slice does not touch `wire-golden.txt` and
  does not collide with slices that raise the version. *Agent decisions:* the
  hello id rather than a `TORE-FIND` id (one fixed id, and an old host drops
  the kind as an unknown one either way); a separate rate limiter with the
  joins' limits, so queries cannot use up the joins' allowance; the answer
  carries the commit and the session id beside what the brief listed, the
  commit so the screen can tell the same build from another and the session id
  so one game answering from two addresses is listed once.
- **The host's answer.** `Server::receive` rate-limits a query and hands it up
  as `ServerEvent::Discover`; `Host::pump` calls `answer_discover`
  (`tore-session`'s `host/discover.rs`), which builds the answer from the
  lobby's state (`Host::discover_answer(nonce)`: name, `MissionSpec::summary()`,
  the connected players in joining order, the King's callsign, capacity, the
  password flag, full, the phase) in every phase, and `Server::answer_discover`
  fits it to the query's length before queuing it. The dedicated server and a
  hosting game answer alike, because both are a `Host`.
- **The search loop** is `net::search::Search`: `Search::start(port, own,
  now)` binds an IPv4 socket with broadcast on; `update(now)` (called every
  frame with a clock's time, never blocks) sends the round's queries every two
  seconds (to 255.255.255.255, to this machine's own network address and to
  loopback, all on the game port), reads the answers whose nonce is its own,
  forgets a game not heard for three rounds and a half, and queues
  `SearchEvent::Added`, `Changed` or `Dropped` for each change (a repeated
  identical answer is no event); `games()` is the list, by name, each game once
  at its best address (a network address before a loopback one) with a
  `Compat` that says the same build, another build or another protocol
  version; `poll_event()` takes the events. Dropping the `Search` stops it.
  *Agent decision (the lead's, 2026-10-01):* the search socket is bound to the
  game port itself when that port is free (`Search::start`), and to an
  ephemeral port when it is not, with a log line saying which
  (`local_port()` and `on_game_port()` tell the caller). A stateful firewall
  (ufw) cannot match a reply to a 255.255.255.255 query and drops it on any
  other port, so answering to the game port lets one rule, `ufw allow
  26900/udp`, cover hosting, joining and discovery. **For EF7:** the search
  holds the game port for as long as the `Search` lives, so the screen must
  drop its `Search` before this game hosts: the New button stops the search
  first, then starts the host, whose bind would otherwise fail with "Cannot
  host on UDP port" (a test in `hosting_tests.rs` covers both orders; with the
  host up, a new search falls back to another port and still finds the game
  through its unicast targets). `tore-app --find-games SECONDS [--port N]`
  runs the loop headlessly and prints each game found
  ([the guide](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#finding-games-from-the-command-line)).
  *Agent decision:* the machine's own network address is a target beside
  loopback, found by pointing an unconnected UDP socket at a far address (no
  packet is sent), so a game hosted here is also found at the address other
  machines use, and where a firewall drops the broadcast of one's own machine
  the list still shows the local game.
- **Addresses.** `tore_net::reach` holds `split_address` (every form: `host`,
  `host:port`, `[v6]`, `[v6]:port`, an IPv4 or IPv6 literal), `resolve` (every
  address, IPv4 first, each once) and `probe` (the handshake's first packet to
  one address, which a host answers with a stateless Challenge or a Refuse:
  `Reach::Answered`, `Refused`, `Silent` or `Cancelled`). `net::lookup::Lookup`
  runs both on a thread of its own: `Lookup::start(text, protocol_version)`
  parses at once and returns an error for text that is no address, `poll()`
  gives `Progress` events (`LookingUp`, `Found`, `Trying`, `NoAnswer`, and the
  last one: `Reached(address)`, `Refused(address, text)` or `Failed(text)`),
  `cancel()` or dropping it stops it, and the screen then joins the address in
  `Reached` with `NetSession::start` as `--connect` does. Each address gets
  three seconds. `--connect` and `tore-bot --connect` now try every address of
  a name the same way (a single address is not tested), blocking at start-up as
  they always did. A zone id (`[fe80::1%eth0]`) is passed to the system's
  lookup unparsed; not tested on a real link-local address.
- **Remembered settings.** `net::settings::Remembered`, one text file
  `network-v1.conf` in the data folder (`tore-network 1`, then `callsign`,
  `port`, `game-name` and up to eight `address` lines, most recent first);
  `--connect` and `--host` remember their address, port, game name and an
  explicit callsign. *Agent decision:* the password is not kept.

#### The Direct Connection screen as built (EF7)

*Built (EF7), 2026-10-01.* The screen is `crates/tore-app/src/direct_screen/`
(`mod.rs` the screen, `options.rs` its Options panel, `app.rs` the game's side,
`preview.rs` the headless pictures, `tests.rs`), made of the widget kit at
NEWNET's rectangles on `NETIPX3`, under its title bar or the player's. Everything below
is an agent decision unless it is credited to John.

- **Reaching it.** Choose Activity's Multi menu has two rows now, *Direct
  Connection...* and *Internet Lobby...* (the public lobby of stage I: it still
  answers "coming soon"); retail's six rows (Serial, Modem, IPX/SPX, TCP/IP,
  Disconnect, Airbase Assault) are not built. The screen covers Choose
  Activity entirely, so the menu is not drawn under it; the window title reads
  "Direct Connection". Single player's rows and screens do not change.
- **The kit's life.** `Menu::new` consumes the imported `Assets`, so it keeps
  what the kit is made of: `widgets::KitSource`, a copy of the menu pieces the
  kit shares with Choose Activity and the multiplayer pieces as bytes (about 3
  MB, built once at start-up for nothing but a copy). The first time the
  screen opens, a thread of its own decodes the kit from it ("Opening Direct
  Connection..." shows on Choose Activity's message line meanwhile, and the
  window keeps running); the game then keeps the `Arc<Kit>` for the rest of
  its life, so the second visit and the lobby (EF8) open at once. Measured:
  the kit builds in about 1.1 ms in a release build and 66 ms in the dev build
  (EF2 estimated 150 ms), so the player hardly sees the message at all.
- **Controls.** Callsign (remembered; a first visit starts in it, and Join and
  New ask for it in words: "Type your callsign first."), Connect to (an
  address or a name with an optional port, an address typed without a port
  uses Options' port), Show full games (kept in `network-v1.conf` as
  `show-full`; John's approved mock puts it on the screen, not in Options),
  Games, Players, Messages, New, Join, Options, Cancel.
  - **Games** lists what the search holds, four a page with the rocker and
    "PAGE n of m": the lock, the name, players over capacity and *Lobby*,
    *Flying* or *Closed*. A game from another build or protocol shows its
    version where the state goes, dimmed, and cannot be joined (so does a full
    game, shown only with "Show full games", and a closing one). The selected
    game's mission shows as a line under the Games box ("Mission: KOLA, clear,
    ..."), and its players in the Players box with the King's crown (a game
    with more players than its answer lists ends with "and N more"; the
    Players box has no pager, the wheel scrolls it).
  - **Join** goes to the selected game's address directly ("Attempting
    connection to 'Friday night' at 192.168.1.20:26900..."), or, for a typed
    address, through the lookup, which puts each step in Messages (looking up,
    found, trying, no answer from ..., answered) and tries every address the
    name gives; the lookup is cancelled by Cancel or Esc ("Cancelled."). When
    both a game is selected and an address typed, Join goes to whichever the
    player touched last (typing takes the list's selection away). A refusal,
    whether the host's at the handshake (full, wrong password, wrong version,
    a content check) or the lookup's, is a plain line in Messages and the
    screen stays.
  - **Enter** presses the default button: Join once a game is selected or an
    address typed, New otherwise (the blue face moves between them). Tab and
    Shift+Tab walk the controls, Esc is Cancel, Up and Down (or the wheel) in
    Connect to step through the addresses joined before (the last eight,
    most recent first), every control works by the mouse too.
  - **Cancel** stops a lookup, else leaves a session the screen started (it
    reads *Leave* then), else leaves the screen, in that order.
  - **Options** is a panel over the screen: the port (saved), the password to
    send when joining and to host with (typed as asterisks, kept while the
    game runs, never written down), the game name when hosting (saved; empty
    is "CALLSIGN's game"), and the retail quick messages, read only (editing
    them is phase 2). OK keeps the values, Cancel and Esc drop them, a bad port
    is refused in the panel.
- **The search.** It starts on the first turn after the screen opens, on the
  remembered port, and stops when the screen closes, when a join or New takes
  over, and while Options is up; it starts again when a join is refused or a
  session the screen started ends, and says what it is doing in Messages once
  for each port and outcome, not each time. It never blocks a frame (`Search::update` every frame, which
  sends one round of queries every two seconds). When the game port is
  already in use on this machine (a dedicated server, or another game, is
  running) the search listens on another port and says so in Messages: "UDP
  port 26977 is busy on this machine (is a game or a server running?), so the
  search listens on port 33590; other computers may not answer." The server
  on this machine is still found, through the search's loopback and own-address
  targets. `tore-server`'s port-in-use message now asks whether a game's Direct
  Connection screen is open on this machine.
- **New** drops the search first (EF5's note: the host needs the game port),
  then starts the host on its thread (EF3) as King, hosting the **Quick
  Mission creator's current mission** (its draft always exists, so "a default
  quick mission if none was built" is the creator's own defaults) with the
  game name from Options or "CALLSIGN's game", the port from Options, the
  password from Options, `open-planes friendly` and the mission's other
  settings at the spec's defaults (no cheats), airborne whatever the creator's
  Start says (EF8: everyone starts airborne). *EF8 replaced EF7's stopgap:*
  New opens the [lobby screen](#the-lobby-screen-as-built-ef8) with the
  hosting player as King and nobody holding a slot, and the mission starts
  only when the King presses Fly. A port in use or a build failure is a plain
  line in Messages ("Cannot host on
  UDP port 26977: Address already in use. Is another game or server using it?
  Choose another port in Options.").
- **After a flight.** *EF8:* a joined player lands in the lobby, flies when
  the King presses Fly, sees the debrief and is back in the lobby. A session
  that ends (a refusal at the handshake, the host leaving, a kick, Leave)
  closes the lobby and its reason is a line in Direct Connection's Messages,
  with the search running again.
- **Glue in other files.** `net/session.rs` has `Join::to(address, ...)` (a
  join to a known address; EF7's `NetSession::auto_restart` is gone, the lobby's
  King presses Fly); `net/play.rs` has
  `start_join` (shared with `--connect`), sends the session's messages to the
  screen instead of the main menu's message line while it is open, and says
  "Connected" there; `net/hosting.rs` has `begin_hosting`, which `--host`
  and the screen share and which returns the reason instead of showing it;
  `net/settings.rs` remembers `show-full`; the kit has `Button::set_default`,
  `TextField::masked` and `KitSource`; `main.rs` holds the screen's field, the
  event routing (keys, text, pointer, wheel, controller menu keys, focus and
  resize) and the snapshot states `--snapshot-state direct`, `direct-games`,
  `direct-trying`, `direct-refused` and `direct-options`.
- **Cost.** The screen's update and draw cost about 0.3 ms a frame in a
  release build with the search running: 0.29 ms in the ignored test
  (`direct_screen::tests::time_screen_frame`, 500 frames, a game selected) and,
  in the windowed game with a `tore-server` found and listed, 0.30 to 0.35 ms of
  draw (worst 1.4 ms on a loaded machine) and 2 to 3 microseconds of update,
  over 26,400 frames (88 windows of 300; `TORE_DIRECT_TIMING=1` logs this every 300 frames). The
  static backdrop (the background, panel, title and headings) is drawn once and
  copied, which took the draw from 0.75 ms to 0.3 ms. The window's present and
  the rest of the frame are not in these numbers. The game redraws the screen
  60 times a second while it is open, as it does for any session; a run with
  `--input-script` spins faster than that (about 1,500 frames a second, as it
  does on Choose Activity), so the script's frame rates say nothing.
- **Not built.** The baked "?" bar of the title picture does nothing (retail's
  second menu bar), the screen has no keyboard shortcut letters, and a name
  chosen from a callsign list (`CALLSIGN.DLG`) is not offered.

### The game port on each system (EF-X)

*Built (EF-X, 2026-10-01).* The search, a hosting game and the dedicated
server share one UDP port, so what each system does when two sockets ask for
it decides who gets the players' datagrams. Measured on the CI runners
(ubuntu-22.04, macos-14, macos-15-intel, windows-2022) and on the development
machine with a probe that binds the sockets in each order:

| | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[::]` socket | dual-stack: takes IPv4, IPv4 broadcast included | dual-stack: takes IPv4, IPv4 broadcast included (macos-14; the Intel runner has no broadcast route) | IPv6 only |
| `Listen::Any` binds | one socket, `[::]:port` | one socket, `[::]:port` | two, `[::]:port` and `0.0.0.0:port` |
| `[::]` while a `0.0.0.0` socket (the search) holds the port | refused | **bound beside it**; IPv4 goes to the other socket | **bound beside it** |
| `0.0.0.0` (the search) while `Listen::Any` holds the port | refused | refused | refused |
| `[::]` while a `127.0.0.1` socket holds the port | refused | refused | bound, and `0.0.0.0` too |

The third row was the defect: before EF-X, `ServerSocket::bind(Listen::Any)`
took "address in use" on its IPv4 socket to mean its own IPv6 socket covered
IPv4, so on macOS and Windows a host or server started while a search held
the port came up on IPv6 alone and no IPv4 player reached it, while the
search kept the port. Now, on "address in use", it frees its IPv6 socket and
tries IPv4 alone: if that binds, the IPv6 socket was covering it and is
bound again; if not, the port is refused on every system with "Cannot host
on UDP port" (the game) or "Cannot listen on" (the server), as Linux always
did. The search binds IPv4 only, so a search started after a host or server
falls back to another port on every system and says so; the New button's
order (stop the search, then host) is unchanged. One firewall rule for the
game port still covers hosting, joining and discovery everywhere: the
search's socket is the game port when it is free, and on Windows the IPv4
socket beside the IPv6 one is what takes the broadcast question. The last
row is Windows letting a wildcard socket share a port with a specific
address; nothing of the game's binds `127.0.0.1` on the game port, so it is
recorded only. Tests: `tore_net::socket`'s `any_binds_one_socket_or_two_on_one_port`
and `any_refuses_a_port_another_socket_holds_for_ipv4`, and
`hosting_tests.rs`'s `the_search_and_the_host_share_the_game_port_one_after_the_other`,
which failed on macOS and Windows before.

### Sleep and wait accuracy on each system (EF-X)

*Measured (EF-X, 2026-10-01)* on the CI runners with a probe test (100
sleeps of each length, and 360 ticks of a host's loop: wake at each 120 Hz
tick or after `MAX_NAP`, through `tore_net::wait_until` with `SPIN_MARGIN`),
three runs each, and a C probe on macOS; a range is the runs' spread:

| Runner | 1 ms sleep, mean / worst | 16 ms sleep, mean / worst | 120 Hz tick, late mean / worst |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ubuntu-22.04 | 1.06 / 1.08 ms | 16.10 to 16.11 / 16.29 ms | 0.14 / 0.45 µs |
| windows-2022 | 1.08 / 1.53 ms | 16.32 / 16.87 ms | 0.2 to 3.7 µs / 1.2 ms |
| macos-14 (Apple silicon) | 4.4 to 8.4 / 11.7 ms | 48 to 90 / 154 ms | 6.2 to 7.5 / 36 ms |
| macos-15-intel | 1.9 to 6.5 / 10.1 ms | 27 to 66 / 142 ms | 1.2 to 2.1 / 20 ms |

A Windows host has no such problem: the 2 ms spin margin is more than its
sleeps need. The macOS runners' processes run at utility QoS (0x11) and
the kernel's timer coalescing lets their timers slip by up to 75 ms
(`kern.timer_coalesce_tier3_ns_max`). In a C probe on the same runners,
user-interactive QoS and `taskpolicy -l 0 -t 0` changed nothing, and a Mach
time-constraint thread policy made a 16 ms sleep last 16.04 ms (worst 17).
So the hosted mission's acceptance test is judged against late inputs on
macOS runners (every correction there followed one; making the sleeps that
coarse on Linux gives the same picture), and its strict form is an ignored
test.

*Built (EF-M, 2026-10-01).* The game's host thread and `tore-server`'s loop
now keep their tick on macOS through `tore-realtime-native`:

- **A Mach time-constraint policy** on the loop's thread, whose timers the
  kernel does not coalesce: period one tick (8.33 ms), computation half a
  tick, constraint one tick, preemptible. *Agent decision, fitted:* half a
  tick covers the host's measured cost (1.3 ms a tick with 30 aircraft,
  3.5 ms in the AI's opening fight, [the server guide](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#performance))
  and the wait's 0.4 ms spin; the work must be done before the next tick.
  The policy is set once the mission is built, since a real-time thread that
  runs long without blocking is demoted by the kernel for a while.
- **An `NSProcessInfo` activity**, `NSActivityUserInitiated |
  NSActivityLatencyCritical`, so App Nap leaves a hidden hosting game alone;
  user-initiated also keeps the Mac from idle sleep while it hosts. The
  game's host thread holds it from its start (before the mission builds) to
  its end, a panic included; `tore-server` holds it for its whole life (its
  `RealTimer`).
- **One log line** as the loop starts: "Host: macOS real-time scheduling
  on" in the game's log, "macOS real-time scheduling on" in the server's,
  or what was refused and why. Linux and Windows log nothing and change
  nothing: both calls are no-ops there.

Measured with the same method by EF-M's probe
(`crates/tore-realtime-native/tests/wait_probe.rs`, an ignored test run on
the CI runners through a temporary workflow, three runs each, workflow run
36946197357), each phase on a fresh thread: nothing applied, the activity
alone, the policy with the activity, and the policy after half a second of
work without blocking (a mission rebuilt on the loop's thread):

| Runner | Applied | 1 ms sleep, mean / worst | 16 ms sleep, mean / worst | 120 Hz tick, late mean / worst |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macos-14 | nothing | 4.6 to 8.3 / 13.5 ms | 51 to 73 / 144 ms | 6.0 to 9.3 / 28.5 ms |
| macos-14 | activity | 4.7 to 8.4 / 25.1 ms | 46 to 71 / 144 ms | 6.0 to 10.3 / 28.4 ms |
| macos-14 | **policy and activity** | 1.02 to 1.44 / 1.77 ms | 16.05 to 16.57 / 22.1 ms | 34 to 272 µs / 1.44 ms |
| macos-14 | policy, after the burst | 1.02 to 1.39 / 1.54 ms | 16.03 to 17.00 / 23.9 ms | 90 to 342 µs / 1.78 ms |
| macos-15-intel | nothing | 3.4 to 6.5 / 10.2 ms | 30 to 76 / 144 ms | 1.4 to 10.2 / 28.8 ms |
| macos-15-intel | activity | 1.9 to 6.9 / 10.2 ms | 30 to 75 / 143 ms | 2.6 to 9.5 / 26.0 ms |
| macos-15-intel | **policy and activity** | 1.08 to 1.11 / 1.28 ms | 16.18 to 16.29 / 30.7 ms | 0.7 to 1.3 µs / 0.40 ms |
| macos-15-intel | policy, after the burst | 1.08 to 1.12 / 1.32 ms | 16.11 to 16.81 / 80.2 ms | 0.4 µs to 2.0 ms / 103 ms |

On Linux and Windows every phase measured what nothing applied measures
(16 ms sleeps 16.07 to 16.45 ms on average, ticks under 4 µs late on
average). What it shows:

- The policy fixes the runners: a 120 Hz tick is noticed under 0.3 ms late
  on average and at most 1.4 ms, against 1.4 to 10 ms and up to 29 ms
  without it. An earlier run with a quarter tick of computation and half a tick of
  constraint (run 36945053889) measured the same (53 µs to 0.3 ms late on
  average, worst 1.4 ms on macos-14; one 17.6 ms outlier on Intel).
- The activity changes nothing on the runners, as expected: their timers
  slip because of their QoS, not App Nap. That it took is shown by `pmset
  -g assertions`, which lists the probe's `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep`
  assertion under the activity's reason on every macOS run. Whether it keeps
  a hidden game's loop on time on a real Mac is not measured.
- After half a second of work without blocking, Apple silicon stayed on
  time; on the Intel runner two of three runs had late stretches (worst 45
  and 103 ms), which looks like the kernel's fail-safe demotion of a busy
  real-time thread, which it lifts by itself. A rebuild happens in the lobby
  or between missions, not in flight. **Remaining risk:** not measured on a
  real Mac; the [server guide](DEDICATED-SERVER.md) says so.

The hosted mission's ignored strict test may pass on the macOS runners now
that the host thread takes the policy; it was not run.

### Real-time tests on shared runners (EF-Y)

*Built (EF-Y, 2026-10-01).* `release.yml` runs the whole test suite on every
platform before it packages, so one intermittent real-time failure on one
runner cost that platform's package. The game's real-time hosting tests run
a host thread, the hosting player's game (the test's own thread, pumped
every 16 ms) and a remote bot (a thread of its own) in real time, beside the
rest of the suite. EF-M's policy keeps the host thread on time on macOS, but
the test's game and bot threads still sleep as the runner lets them (up to
140 ms for 16, table above). Each such test now has two forms:

| Test | Normal suite (every runner) | Strict form (ignored; `network.yml`'s `strict-real-time` job on Linux) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A hosted mission flies with no correction | No correction after seating without a late input in the second before it; at most one mismatch without one (the 32-bit Windows runner had one in 975, which no correction followed) | `a_hosted_mission_flies_with_no_correction_at_all`: no correction after seating and no mismatch |
| A two-second window stall stalls nobody | The guest's view of the host during the stall: 96 to 144 ticks a second (108 to 132 until CI-fix) and 24 snapshots a second over what it saw, no gap over 1 s; after the stall at most one correction without a late input, none once recovered | `..._strictly`: 216 to 264 ticks in the stall, no gap over 150 ms, at most one correction after it, none once recovered |
| An eight-second window stall drops nobody | The same view of the host; the rest (catch-up, settling, the crown, End mission) as before | `..._strictly`: 912 to 1008 ticks, no gap over 150 ms |
| A joined game stalled for 15 seconds is kept and recovers (EF-K, CI-fix) | After it resumes, two seconds with no correction that a late input in the second before does not explain | `..._strictly`: two seconds with no correction at all |

The rates are taken between the guest's own first and last readings in the
stall, so a guest that wakes late measures them right; the ticks at the
stall's two ends, which the strict form counts, are short by however late it
woke (a gap of 195 ms on macos-15-intel failed the old form). A host held up
by the stalled game would still fail the normal form: its gap would be the
stall's length and its rates near zero. The rule that a stall costs at most
one correction is also held exactly on the network simulator
(`a_stalled_game_recovers_with_at_most_one_correction` in tore-session).

Two more failures were not real time at all:

- **The diagnostics tests' folders.** Each named its temporary folder by the
  process and the clock in nanoseconds, but macOS's clock counts whole
  microseconds, so two tests starting together could share a folder and take
  each other's maintenance lock (a WouldBlock on macos-15-intel). The name
  now carries a counter as well.
- **A name that does not resolve.** The lookup test asked the system to
  resolve `no-such-host.invalid`, and on the macOS runner the lookup did not
  end in "Cannot find the server" within the test's 5 seconds (the test did
  not print what it saw instead). The test now uses a fake
  resolver that fails as the system's does; `tore_net::reach`'s own test
  still asks the system (it waits as long as the resolver takes), and the
  whole lookup through the system's resolver is the ignored
  `a_name_the_system_cannot_resolve_fails`, run by the strict job.

*Agent decisions:* the normal suite's bounds (1 s, a tenth of the tick rate,
24 snapshots a second, one unexplained mismatch) and the strict forms' home
in `network.yml` rather than `ci.yml`. **Open:** the 32-bit Windows runner's
one mismatch with no late input and no correction after it is not
explained; with one starved core on Linux every mismatch followed a late
input.

**CI-fix (2026-10-05).** `ci.yml` had failed on `multiplayer` since the net
lane (eb60701b). Each failure and what was done:

| Failure | Runner | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test_battery.DriverTests`, 5 errors | both Windows | The battery's driver ended processes with `os.killpg`, which Windows lacks | `battery.stop_group`: the process group on Linux and macOS, the process alone on Windows; the tests check a process is gone through its `Popen` |
| tore-sim tests did not compile | windows i686 | A test wrote the count `1 << 40`, more than a 32-bit `usize` holds | The count is `1 << 30` |
| `client::matrix_tests::rtt_50_loss_5`, one unexplained correction, every run | macos-14 | Not runner timing (the matrix runs on simulated time and failed identically each run) and not a defect of the slices: the host's flight step was a second compiled copy whose sine and cosine rounded the pitch differently ([one compiled copy](#one-step-for-a-humans-plane)). F2-S's score messages moved the simulator's packet losses, and the new flight found the case | `fly` compiled once; the matrix unchanged |
| `a_joined_game_stalled_for_fifteen_seconds_is_kept_and_recovers` | macos-15-intel, once | Runner timing: the guest's starved thread sent late inputs for eight seconds after the stall, each a small correction | Normal and strict forms, as the hosting tests (table above) |
| `an_eight_second_window_stall_drops_nobody_and_the_king_still_reigns` | macos-15-intel, once | Runner timing: 107.6 ticks a second against a floor of 108 | The lenient band is a fifth either side of 120 |
| `a_listed_game_is_joined_directly_through_the_masters_introduction_and_flown` (every run), `a_browse_lists_a_masters_games_and_asks_for_the_details_of_one` (sometimes) | both Windows | The tests' master had no probe port, and the game takes the master's main port + 1 to be it (`probe_address`). Windows hands out ports in order, so the hosting game's socket, or the browse test's host, took that port: the joiner read the host's answers as malformed master packets (the direct path never answered and the join went through the relay), and the browse's mapping Probe reached the test's host instead of a Challenge | The tests' masters take their probe port at the main port + 1 (`browse::testing::bind_on_loopback`), as `tore-server`'s listing test already did |

The 32-bit Windows runner's unexplained mismatch (**Open**, above) may have
the same cause as the macOS matrix failure, two compiled copies of the step;
it was not seen again, and is not proven.

### The lobby

A host has a new phase, **Lobby**, before Flying and after each mission. In it
the mission is chosen but not flying, players are connected but not seated,
and the host sends every player the lobby's state whenever it changes.

| Element | Who | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mission | everyone sees; the King edits | The mission's summary. **Mission...** opens the Quick Mission creator as it is, with its Fly button reading Accept; Accept returns to the lobby and sends the new mission to everyone |
| Slots | everyone | Every friendly aircraft (co-op): wing, member, type, and who flies it (a callsign, or AI). A player takes a free slot by clicking it |
| Players | everyone | Callsigns with the King's crown and the host's house, and who is ready |
| Messages and chat line | everyone | System lines and chat; Enter sends |
| Loadout | a seated player | The Load Ordnance page for the player's own slot; every player arms their own aircraft (John, 2026-10-01) |
| Ready | a seated player | Ready or not; a player marks ready once their loadout is chosen (John, 2026-10-01) |
| Fly | the King | Starts the mission when every seated player is ready |
| Leave | everyone | Back to Direct Connection; the King's leaving ends the session for a player-hosted game |

When the King presses Fly the host builds the mission (`World::new` with open
seating), seats every ready player in the slot they chose with the loadout they
armed, and starts its clock; everyone starts airborne (John, 2026-09-28). A
player who joins while the mission flies takes an AI aircraft in flight, as
stage D does, with that aircraft's loadout. When the mission ends each player
sees the debrief, then the lobby again, still connected (John, 2026-10-01); the
King can change the mission and fly again.

On the wire the lobby is a handful of new reliable messages (lobby state, take
or leave a slot, loadout, ready, the King's mission and settings, start, chat,
kick, pass the crown) and a protocol version bump. A dedicated server keeps the
mission its file names and has no King: its players pick slots and get ready, and
it starts as its `start` setting says. *Agent decisions.*

*Built (EF4)*, on the wire and in the sessions (EF8 built the screen on this). Each an agent decision unless credited.

- **The King** in a game a player hosts is the hosting player's own
  connection: `HostConfig::king` (since F2-1 `HostConfig::house`, the house
  that wears the crown when it joins) is the in-process link's address
  (`tore_net::LINK_ADDRESS`), which no UDP sender can have, with
  `StartMode::King`. Only the King changes the mission, starts it, ends it
  and kicks; anyone else asking is refused ("Only the King may do that.").
  The King's departure, or the host's (`Host::host_left`), ends the game for
  everyone: a flying mission ends with the reason "the host left the game"
  and the debriefs, and each player gets a Goodbye before the disconnect,
  which the client words as "The host left the game." *The King's
  connection never times out:* the host exempts it from the transport's
  5-second silence timeout (`tore_net::Server::set_silence_exempt`), and only
  when the King is at the link's address, which the hosted game's `Linked`
  transport refuses to any socket datagram, so no remote player can claim it.
  A hosting window held still (dragged or resized on Windows, a long load, a
  modal; [what stalls the loop](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)) stalls only that game: the mission flies on for everyone, the King's
  plane on its last controls for half a second and then neutral, as any
  stalled game's ([the stall rule](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)), and when the window
  comes back the client catches up as after any stall. The connection cannot
  really go silent for good: if the game goes away, its host thread goes with
  it, and a game that drops its host stops it politely. A King at a network
  address (phase 2) is dropped for silence like any player. Measured
  (`net/hosting_tests.rs`): an 8-second stall of the game side, with a remote
  bot flying; the host stepped 959 to 961 ticks, the bot's longest gap between
  snapshots was 34 to 39 ms, nobody was dropped, and the hosting player
  caught up by taking the host's newest state (a catch-up, rather than
  stepping the whole backlog), then had 0 to 8 corrections, the largest
  0.005 ft and 1.2 degrees, one every 125 ms at most, and none after (with
  the whole test suite running beside this real-time test the debug client is
  starved and is corrected for a few seconds more before it settles), and
  its End mission then returned both players to the lobby. A
  dedicated server has no King. The host's house is the King's player in a hosted game and nobody
  on a server. Passing the crown and the King's other settings are phase 2;
  the lobby state carries an empty settings list, and message kinds 23 and 24
  are kept for them.
- **The lobby state** goes to every player whenever it changes: the game's
  name, the mission's summary (`MissionSpec::summary`) and number, the phase
  (lobby, flying, ended), the start rule, the King and the house, the
  receiving player's own id, the players in the order they connected (lobby
  id, callsign, slot, ready, armed, flying, why the player's import
  cannot play the mission, if it cannot, and, since protocol 7, the platform
  its game said it runs on when it joined: Windows, macOS, Linux or unknown,
  John 2026-10-05), and the slots: the planes open to
  players (every friendly plane by default; a server's `open-planes`), each
  with its wing, member, aircraft and holder. A slot is held without seating
  anyone; one holder a slot. The state goes out only when something changed,
  and changes in quick succession go together: a player in the lobby gets at
  most one state every 250 ms, a flying one at most one a second, since its
  messages share 256 bytes of each snapshot packet. A connection's lobby
  requests are held to 20 a second (the rest of that second's are dropped
  unanswered and noted once in the log), and the same refusal is logged at
  most once a second. Lobby ids go round rather than being given again at
  once, so a King's kick meant for a player who just left never lands on the
  next.
- **Messages** (protocol 3, [layouts](formats/net-protocol.md#messages-as-built)).
  Player to host: Slot (take a plane's slot, the first free one, or leave),
  Loadout (for the player's own slot, or the standard load), Set ready, and
  the King's Change mission, Start, Kick (with the reason the player sees)
  and End mission. Host to player: Lobby, Refused (the request and why),
  Goodbye (kicked, or the host left) and Flight loadouts. Stage D's Ready is
  now Take plane: in the lobby it holds that plane's slot (or the first free
  one) and marks ready, in flight it flies the plane now, which is what a
  game with no lobby screen sends. Every lobby request names the lobby
  mission's number, and one meant for an earlier mission is refused.
- **Loadouts.** A player sends the loadout for its own slot; the host checks
  it with the rule the single-player Load Ordnance page applies before Fly,
  and refuses one it does not allow with that rule's words ("Station
  quantity exceeds capacity."). The rule stays where it was, shared:
  `tore_sim::combat::loadout::Loadout::validate` (each quantity within the
  station's capacity for that weapon, only weapons connected to flight, the
  fuel within the tanks, the weight within the maximum take-off weight).
  `tore_world::mission::LoadoutSpec::check_for_plane` puts the loadout on the
  aircraft's standard load and adds what the page's controls guarantee: one
  station for each, each station's capacity the page's, and nothing but the
  gun with the creator's Guns only. Cheat loading is refused unless the
  King's `loadouts any` (F2-1: `LoadoutSpec::check_in` takes the rule from
  the mission). Loadouts are chosen in the lobby only; one
  sent while the mission flies is refused. At the start the mission is built
  again with the held slots' loadouts (`MissionSpec::plane_loadouts`), each
  player is sent them (Flight loadouts) with the manifest entries they add
  (a loadout's other weapons), builds its copy again with them and compares
  those entries as at the mission's content check, and a joiner in flight
  gets the whole text with them, so its build and content manifest match the
  host's. A player whose copy differs is told and stays in the lobby, marked
  unable for that flight only: the mark goes when the lobby returns, and the
  client builds the lobby's mission again. A start whose build fails is
  refused to the King with the build's words.
- **Ready and start.** A player holding a slot marks ready. The King's Start
  is accepted in the lobby when every player holding a slot is ready and at
  least one holds one ("Not ready: Hawk." otherwise). The host then builds
  the mission and every ready player holding a slot takes its plane at the
  first tick, airborne (John, 2026-09-28). A player with no slot stays in the
  lobby while the mission flies; a player who joins, or gets ready, while it
  flies takes its slot's plane (or any free one) in flight, as stage D does.
- **The King's mission.** The host parses and builds the new mission to
  check it (refused with the build's own words), keeps it, frees the slots
  whose plane no longer exists (and the loadout of a plane whose aircraft
  changed, or that the new mission refuses, such as missiles under a new
  Guns only, whose player is told by a Notice), clears every ready and unable
  mark, raises the mission's number
  and sends it to every player, who builds it and runs the content check. A
  player whose import cannot play it sends Content refused with the reason,
  stays in the lobby marked unable (its slot freed; it cannot take one), and
  every player, the King included, sees why. Only in the lobby.
- **The return.** When a mission ends, every player gets Mission ended and,
  if it flew, its debrief, and the host returns to the lobby with everyone
  still connected, slots and loadouts kept and ready marks cleared (John,
  2026-10-01). A player who leaves its flight (Leave) is back in the lobby
  too, and the mission flies on for the others. The King's End mission ends
  it for everyone.
- **Kick.** The King's Kick sends the player a Goodbye with the King's words,
  gives its plane back to the AI with no debrief, and disconnects it once the
  goodbye is acknowledged. The King cannot kick the King.
- **Flights.** A connection now outlives a flight, and a new mission's ticks
  start again from 0, so each seating starts a new flight of the connection
  whose sections never meet the last one's
  ([protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#flights)).
- **A game hosted from the command line** (`tore-app --host`) is the King:
  its client takes its slot and readies by itself, and its game starts each
  mission as soon as every player holding a slot is ready and the hosting
  player is not reading a debrief (a game with a lobby screen, EF8, never starts
  by itself: its King presses Fly); a mission's end
  returns everyone to the lobby at once, a mission nobody flies any more ends
  at once, and End Mission ends the mission for everyone. Leaving or quitting
  ends the game for everyone. `tore-app --connect` takes `--slot` or the
  first free slot with the standard loadout and readies by itself, shows each
  mission's debrief and flies the next; its End Mission leaves the game. The
  lobby's changes go to the game's log.
- **The client session** exposes it all ([the calls](#the-client-session)):
  `Client::lobby()` and `ClientEvent::Lobby` when it changes; `take_slot`,
  `take_any_slot`, `leave_slot`, `send_loadout`, `set_ready`, and for the
  King `change_mission`, `start_mission`, `kick` and `end_mission`, each
  answered by the next lobby state or a `ClientEvent::Refused`; `unable()`,
  `goodbye()` and `close_text`. `ClientConfig::auto_ready` (on by default)
  makes the client take its slot (the plane asked for, else the first free
  one) with the standard loadout and mark ready whenever it is in the lobby,
  after each return and each mission change: what `tore-bot`, `--connect`
  and `--host` use. The lobby screen turns it off (`Join::lobby`, EF8).
- **The bot** plays the lobby that way, and a bot that is the King
  (`Bot::start_when_ready`) starts each mission once everyone holding a slot
  is ready. `tore-bot` leaves the game after `--seconds` (ending its flight
  first and waiting for its debrief) and prints the lobby's changes.
- **The dedicated server's lobby** has no King: [its rules](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#the-lobby).
- **Measured** (`client/lobby_tests.rs`, `host/tests.rs`, the synthetic
  import on the network simulator; `net/hosting_tests.rs` in real time): a
  King and two players took slots, armed (one loadout refused with the
  page's reason), readied (the King's early Start refused, naming who was
  not ready), flew with each player's loadout on its aircraft on the host,
  were returned to the lobby by the King's End mission and flew a second
  mission on a second flight of each connection; the King's mission change,
  an import that cannot play the mission, a kick, a join in flight and the
  server's start rules each behave as above. The hosted game, the King's
  bot and a remote bot over loopback UDP flew, were returned to the lobby
  and flew again.

*Correction to EF3's finding (EF4):* after the game side stalls for 2
seconds, the hosting player's plane was adopted at every queued snapshot (60
corrections, 58 of them adoptions about 26 ft each), because the exact states
that queued during the stall were applied on arrival, before the prediction
had stepped to the update's time, so each was a tick the client had not
reached. The client now applies only the newest exact state, after the
update's steps, and holds it while the host still reports repeating its late
inputs (at most 125 ms from when the hold began, however long the inputs
stay late); it steps the ticks the host has already stepped
without its input with the controls the host repeated; a prediction more
than 30 ticks behind its clock takes the host's newest exact state ahead of it
rather than step the whole backlog (a catch-up, counted apart from
corrections in `ClientStats::catch_ups`); and its inputs start
after the newest snapshot's tick. A 2-second stall now costs one correction
(0.01 ft on the simulator) in the tests, and at most one in the hosted test.

#### The lobby screen as built (EF8)

*Built (EF8), 2026-10-01.* The screen is `crates/tore-app/src/lobby_screen/`
(`mod.rs` the screen, `facts.rs` every rule on who may press what and the
words, `modal.rs` the Kick and Leave panels, `app.rs` the game's side,
`preview.rs` the headless pictures, `tests.rs`), made of the widget kit on
Direct Connection's background and panel. Everything below is an agent decision
unless it is credited to John.

**Opening and closing.** Join and New on Direct Connection open it as soon as
the session starts (`Join::lobby`, `begin_hosting(options, true)`): the game
shows "Connecting to the game..." until the host's first lobby state arrives.
The client's `auto_ready` is off, the King's game never starts a mission by
itself and a joiner's End Mission in flight returns that player to the lobby
(`client.leave`) instead of leaving the game. `--connect` and `--host` are
unchanged. The lobby ends with the session: Leave (the King is asked first:
"Leaving ends the game for everyone. Leave?"), a kick, the host leaving or a
connection that fails put its reason (`close_text`) in Direct Connection's
Messages, and the search starts again. The window title reads "Lobby".

**Layout** (640 by 480, in the Direct Connection panel; the title reads
"Lobby", text fields are John's grey boxes):

| Element | Place | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game, Mission, start rule | three lines at (45, 106), (45, 120), (45, 134) | The game's name; the mission's summary; the start rule in plain words (the King's, or "This server starts the mission as soon as the first player holding a slot is ready.", or "always flying") |
| Slots | list (45, 168), 286 wide, five rows, rocker and PAGE box to its right | Own mark, "Wing 1 #3", aircraft, holder or AI, the holder's ready tick. Another player's slot is dimmed, your own green with the blue arrow |
| Players | list (404, 168), 186 wide, five rows | Crown (the King), house (the machine that runs the game), ready tick or red cross (unable), callsign (your own row green), status word (Armed, Ready, Flying, Unable, Slot) |
| Hint line | (45, 266) | What to do next, or the reason a selected player is unable |
| Messages and chat line | box (45, 294), 549 by 78; line (45, 377), 549 by 18 | EF6's `LobbyChat`: the game's words and chat in the Messages colours |
| Buttons | y 419, 85 wide, places at x 45, 138, 231, 324, 417, 510 | King: Mission..., Loadout, Ready, Kick, Fly, Leave. Everyone else: Loadout, Ready, Leave in the last three places |

**Who may press what** (`facts::buttons`, tested):

| Button | Offered to | Enabled when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mission... | the King (never on a server) | connected, mission not flying |
| Loadout | everyone | a slot is held, the player's game can play the mission, mission not flying |
| Ready | everyone | a slot is held, the game can play the mission, not flying; reads **Not Ready** when ready and **Join** while the mission flies |
| Kick | the King | a player other than the King is selected in Players |
| Fly | the King | every player holding a slot is ready (and one holds one); reads **End Mission** while the mission flies and ends it for everyone (a King who never joined the flight would otherwise have no way to stop it) |
| Leave | everyone | always |

A button that cannot be pressed stays drawn disabled; clicking it says why in
Messages ("Not ready: Hawk, Viper.", "Nobody holds a slot.", "Take a slot
first.", "Select another player in Players to kick.", the unable reason). Fly's
text for the unready is the host's own ("Not ready: ..."). The blue default
button, and so Enter (in the chat line only when it is empty), is Fly when it
can be pressed, else Ready once a slot is held and not marked.

**Slots and ready.** A click on a free slot takes it; a click on one's own
frees it; another player's slot cannot be clicked and says so. A double-click
is one click. Changing slot clears the ready mark and the loadout, as the host
does. Ready with no loadout chosen says "Ready with the standard stores. Press
Loadout first to choose others." Messages also tells who joined and left, the
mission changing, the mission flying and the return to the lobby, and a player
whose import cannot play the mission with the reason (that player's row is red
with a cross, its slot freed).

**While the mission flies** the same screen shows to a player with no flight (a
late joiner, or one who pressed End Mission): it can take a slot and press Join
(Ready) to fly at once. Measured against a `tore-server` with `start now`: the
game joined a flying mission from the lobby and flew a Tomcat, and its End
Mission returned it to the lobby of the still flying mission. The host may
refuse a plane (one shot down already: "No plane: Plane 2 is destroyed or has
lost its pilot.") and the line is in Messages.

**After the mission** each player's debrief closes to the lobby, still
connected, slots and loadouts kept (the Players list shows Armed again) and
ready cleared. The King's End Mission ends it for everyone; a joiner's returns
that player alone.

**A dedicated server's lobby** has no King: no Mission..., Kick or Fly, the
crown column is empty, and the start rule is in the head. Leave never asks.

**The creator in Accept mode** (the King's Mission...). The single-player
creator opened on `Screen::Quick` with `QuickMission::lobby` set: its OK button
reads **Accept** and answers as OK does; Start is locked to Airborne (touching
Start, by either mouse button, or its airport, says "Multiplayer: everyone
starts airborne, so Start is locked to Airborne. Accept sends this mission to
the lobby." in a notice at the lower left that does not cover the Start line);
what the host cannot take is reported by Accept before anything is sent
(`QuickMission::lobby_spec`: ground targets and unflyable aircraft, as single
player, a developer theater layout, and a mission the text form would change).
Accept sends `change_mission` and waits: the next lobby state with a new
mission number closes the creator; the host's refusal (the build's words) is
the creator's notice and stays. Cancel or Esc puts the draft back as it was
and sends nothing. Single player's creator is unchanged (the flag is off:
its OK, its Start, its notice and its drawing are as before, and a test covers
both).

**Load Ordnance in lobby mode** (Loadout). The single-player page for the
aircraft of the held slot (`Ordnance::lobby`): Fly reads **Accept** and Select
Plane reads **Cancel**, the mission's Guns only is applied when it opens and
said on the page, and Cheat loading answers "Cheat loading is not allowed in a
multiplayer game." (the page's menu reads "Cheat  Off (not allowed)"). Accept
checks the loadout with the host's own rule
(`LoadoutSpec::check_for_plane`), puts its words on the page when it fails
("Guns only is selected. Unload other weapons or return to setup and change
the restriction."), and otherwise sends it. The host answers only a refusal,
so the page closes when none has come in a second (0.3 s when the lobby already
showed the player armed); a refusal that arrives later (the mission changed) is a
line in Messages. The page is kept for the next visit while the mission and the
slot stay. Single player's `quick.ordnance` is set aside and put back, so its
page keeps its own loadout.

**Cost.** The screen's update is under a microsecond and its draw 0.35 ms a
frame in a release build (500 runs of the ignored test
`lobby_screen::tests::time_lobby_frame`: mean 0.348 ms, p95 0.359 ms; in the
windowed game with a bot joined, `TORE_DIRECT_TIMING=1` logged 0.358 ms mean
over 35 windows of 300 frames, worst frame 0.8 ms), against Direct
Connection's 0.26 to 0.35 ms: the static backdrop is drawn once and copied.

**Measured** (windowed, release build, `tools/agent-run.sh`, one window with a
`tore-bot` for the second player; the run scripts and screenshots are in the
lead's notes, `.local/mp-notes/ef8-run/`): Direct Connection, New, the lobby
as King, Mission... with the creator (a friendly wing of four), the locked
Start, Accept, a slot taken, Loadout with the weapons unloaded and an
AIM-9X on the wingtip, Accept, the bot joining and chatting, a line typed and
sent, Ready, Fly, the flight, End Mission, the debrief, the lobby again (the
bot Ready, the King's loadout kept), a second flight, Kick with a reason (the
bot was told "The King removed you from the game: spam"), and Leave with its
confirmation, back on Direct Connection. A second run joined a `tore-server`
from Direct Connection, took a slot, readied (the server starts at once), flew,
ended, and was back in the server's lobby, readied again and left; a third
joined a flying mission as described above; a fourth saw the server stop while
the game sat in its lobby and showed "The server ended the connection: the
server is stopping." on Direct Connection.

##### Smoke-test fixes (EF-F)

*Built (EF-F), 2026-10-01; each an agent decision
unless it is the lead's brief.* The EF9 smoke test (a hosting game, two more
games and a bot, in the lead's notes `.local/mp-notes/ef9/`) found these and
they are fixed:

- **Leaving one's own flight and joining it again.** A player who ended its
  flight (Ctrl+Q, back in the lobby while the others fly) and pressed Join was
  seated by the host, but its window stayed on the lobby saying "You are
  flying." with Loadout and Join greyed, and its plane flew neutral; only
  Leave worked. The cause: the game's own build of the mission
  (`net::session::Built`: the world the screens read and the drawn model of
  every aircraft type) is made once for each mission the host sends, when the
  client loads it, and `begin_session_flight` took it (`net_built.take()`) for
  the first seating. A second seating in the same running mission found none
  and waited for a build that never came. The session now keeps the mission's
  spec and the import (`NetSession::rebuild`) and `begin_session_flight`
  builds the mission again for a seating that has no build left (about the
  time the mission takes to load; the player has just pressed Join). A player
  can leave and join the same flight any number of times. The King has no such
  path to mend: its End Mission ends the mission for everyone, and the next
  mission is a new load (`Fly` in the lobby). Test:
  `net/rejoin_tests.rs` seats a lobby-mode `NetSession` three times in one
  running mission with its End Mission between (the synthetic import has no
  aircraft models, so the test checks that a build is made and kept for each
  seating; the windowed run flies it with the real import).
- **The debrief's headline.** The host's report says only whether the
  objectives were met, so a mission the King ended, or a joiner's own End
  Mission, read "MISSION FAILURE / You failed this Quick Mission." The
  networked debrief now decides in `net::debrief::ending` from the report and
  who ended it (the host's `MissionEnded` reason, which arrives just before the
  debrief, or the player's own Leave): the result stands, with the retail page,
  when the objectives were met (**MISSION SUCCESS**), or when the flight was
  lost (the player's pilot dead or ejected, or a friendly objective destroyed:
  **MISSION FAILURE**); anything else shows **MISSION ENDED** with one
  sentence: "You left the mission." (the player's own End Mission),
  "You ended the mission for everyone." (the King's own), "The King ended the
  mission." (a player who is not the King), "The server ended the mission."
  (a dedicated server's operator: the lobby has no King), "The time limit ended
  the mission.", "Everyone left the mission.", "The host is stopping the
  game." (a hosted game) or "The server is stopping.", and "The host left the
  game.". The outcome line on the second page reads **MISSION OUTCOME : INCOMPLETE**
  for these, retail's own word for a multiplayer mission that did not run to
  its end ([the debrief format notes](formats/debrief.md#page-contents)); the
  headline and sentences are the agent's. The retail first page's own layout is kept (its heading
  and sentence are replaced); the objectives and tables are the report's.
  Single player's debrief is unchanged: it still calls `Debrief::new`, which
  is now `Debrief::networked` with no ending and draws and words exactly as
  before (the existing page tests cover it).
- **Who removed a player.** A removed player's screen read "The King removed
  you from the game: ..." from a dedicated server, which has no King. The
  client words it by the lobby state it holds (`king` is empty on a server):
  "The server removed you from the game: ..." from a server and "The King
  removed you from the game: ..." from a game a player hosts
  (`Client::close_text`).
- **The diagnostics log says what the screen says.** The client's `net-*.tsv`
  `closed` and `refused` rows now use `Client::close_text`: a joiner whose
  host left logged "The server ended the connection: the server is stopping."
  while its screen read "The host left the game."; both now read "The host
  left the game." (and a kick logs the kick's wording).
- **A stale Closed row.** After a session ended, Direct Connection restarted
  its search and listed the game just left as "0/4 Closed" for the few seconds
  it still answered. The screen remembers the address of the game of the
  session that ended (the game joined, or this machine's game port for a game
  it hosted) and does not list that game while it answers Closed, nor say
  that it was found or lost in Messages; it is a game like any other once it
  answers anything else (a server's next mission) or has gone from the search.
  A game closing that was not just left shows as Closed, as before.
- **The cheat notice on the lobby's Load Ordnance page** ("Cheat loading is
  not allowed in a multiplayer game.", and the page's other messages) sat at
  the low left, over the names of the bottom two weapon rows. In lobby mode it
  now sits in the strip of backdrop between the title bar and the two panels,
  which covers no label. Single player's page is unchanged (the notice is
  where it was; both places are tested).
- **`stall SECONDS`**, a step of `--input-script` (at most 600 seconds): blocks
  the game's whole main loop, frames, the session's pump and the script
  itself, for that long, as a window held still or a long frame does. It is
  how a smoke test checks the keepalive and the neutral flying of a stalled
  game with a real loop stall: stopping the process (SIGSTOP) freezes the
  keepalive thread too, so it cannot. Listed with the other steps in
  [development](DEVELOPMENT.md#windowed-runs-from-scripts-and-agents) and in
  `input_script.rs`.

### Chat

Chat goes through the host, which forwards each line to its receivers:

| Receiver | Who hears it |
| --- | --- |
| All | Everyone (the only receiver in the lobby, as in retail) |
| Friendlies | The sender's side |
| Enemies | The other side |
| Wing | The sender's wing |
| Target | The human flying the sender's designated target |

- **Lobby:** the Messages box shows chat and system lines; a line at the
  bottom of the panel takes text, Enter sends (to All).
- **In flight** (John, 2026-10-01, kept simple): the `~` key (backtick on the
  same key) opens the chat line; while it is open Tab chooses the receiver,
  Enter sends and Esc closes it. Enter designates the nearest visible aircraft
  in flight, so it sends only while the line is open. While the line is open
  the keyboard types instead of flying; the joystick still flies. F1 to F12 send
  the matching line of `CHAT.TXT` only while the chat line is open, since the F
  keys are the views (*agent decision*).
- **The chat window** in flight is at the top left of the screen (John,
  2026-10-01), apart from the HUD's messages at the bottom, each line coloured
  by who sent it and to whom: **green** for the player's own side (to the side,
  the wing or the player), **blue** for a line to everyone from the player's
  side, **red** for a line from the enemy side. Retail's `MPSTATUS` art and
  font are the menus' connected-state window, not the flight pane (EF0), so
  retail's in-flight pane is unknown and only a reference; EF6 did not use
  them (below).
- Limits (*agent proposal*, built in EF6): 80 characters a line, five lines in five seconds
  a player, and observers do not reach the players flying (John,
  2026-09-28, refined 2026-10-01: they talk among themselves).
  Retail keeps `CHAT.TXT` text to 50 characters a line (EF0, S), shorter than
  this limit.

*Built (EF6)*, on the wire, in the host and in the game. The messages are
[kinds 25 and 26 of protocol 4](formats/net-protocol.md#chat-as-built); each
choice below an agent decision unless credited.

- **On the host** (`tore_session::host::chat`). A player's line goes to the host,
  which trims it, checks it, routes it and logs it (`HostLog::Chat`: the
  dedicated server writes `chat: Viper to friendlies (2 heard): Form up` to
  its console and log, and the hosting game to its log). **All** goes
  to every other connection, **Friendlies** and **Enemies** to the players
  flying on the sender's side or the other, **Wing** to those in the sender's
  wing, **Target** to the human flying the aircraft the sender has designated
  (`world.combat.state.view(plane).designated()`, an aircraft only). A player
  with no plane sends to All only and hears All only. **Observers** (John,
  2026-10-01): while a mission flies, a connection with no plane is an
  observer. *The lead's reading of who hears whom:* an observer's All reaches
  only the other observers, never a player flying; a flying player's All
  reaches observers and flyers alike. With nothing flying everyone is in the
  lobby and All reaches everyone. The sender is sent its own line back
  (retail's `YOU TO ALL`), so it sees what went out; then, if no other player
  heard it (an observer alone hears no one), "No one hears you." An AI-flown
  target hears nothing, so that is the case there; with nothing designated
  Target is refused ("You have no target designated."). A departed player is
  no longer a connection, and a plane the AI flies again has no human in it,
  so neither hears anything. The one place that decides is `Host::chat`.
- **Limits.** 80 characters of printable ASCII (space to `~`, the retail
  fonts' range), spaces trimmed from both ends, an empty line dropped
  silently, five lines in five seconds a player (a sliding window over the
  lines the host accepted; a refused line does not count), and the lobby's 20
  requests a second. Every refusal is a system line to the sender alone and a
  line in the log (the same words once a second at most). A quick message
  names a number 1 to 12 and a sound name of at most 12 printable
  characters ending `.5K` or `.11K`; otherwise it is refused.
- **Quick messages.** `CHAT.TXT`'s twelve lines are read from the pack once at
  start (`net::chat::load_quick_messages`) and an F key sends line n with its
  own receiver (or the one the player has picked, for a line with none) and
  its sound's name. The host forwards the sound to the receivers, who play it
  as a cockpit effect; **the sender does not hear its own** (the retail
  answer is unknown, EF0). A non-ASCII character of the file becomes `?`.
- **The client** (`Client::chat`, `chat_quick`, `chat_send`, and
  `ClientEvent::Chat`): a line the rules refuse before it is sent (empty, too
  long, not printable ASCII, a receiver other than All before flight, not
  connected) comes back as a `Refusal` for the caller to show; the host's
  answers arrive as `ClientEvent::Chat` lines, the player's own among them
  (`you`), and the host's words as system lines. The request is recorded in
  the capture like a lobby request, so a replay sends it again.
- **The flight's line** (`net/chat.rs`; `main.rs` calls it before the flight
  takes a key). `~` (physical Backquote, or a `` ` `` or `~` the layout
  prints) with no Ctrl, Alt or Super opens it while a networked flight shows,
  no menu or map is up and the window has the focus. Opening lets go of every
  held key (`Input::release_keys`), the trigger and the instrument press, as a
  menu does; the joystick and the mouse go on flying. Open, every key press is
  the line's; releases pass on to the flight. Tab goes round All, Friendlies,
  Enemies, Wing, Target (Shift+Tab back); the receiver is kept between
  openings and goes back to All when the flight ends. Enter sends and closes
  the line (an empty one just closes); Esc closes it; F1 to F12 send the quick
  message and close it. The key is a fixed row of the Controls screen ("Chat
  line (network games only)", Communication) and not rebindable; the keys
  while the line is open are in [the controls list](CONTROLS.md#built-in-controls-outside-the-tables).
  Single player never opens it (the hook needs a networked flight).
- **The window** (`Chat::draw`). The last 6 lines, at a place John chose
  (2026-10-01) from the instruments' layout setting (`App.instruments.layout`)
  at every draw, so changing the setting moves it: with the Small layout (six
  across the bottom) the top left, 5 layer units from the edges, wrapped at
  320 of the 640-unit layer; with the Large layout (the default) the left gap
  between the upper-left and lower-left instruments, in their column (162
  layer units wide less 4 either side, from 4 below the upper instrument to 4
  above the lower, anchored to the window's left edge like the instruments), so it covers neither
  at any window shape. Whole lines that do not fit the gap's height are
  dropped, oldest first, and the key hint goes before the open line does. The
  text is in the HUD font at the HUD's scale with its filtered edges, over a band of
  translucent black (60 percent) so every colour reads on sky or ground. A
  line stays 15 seconds and fades over the last 3; the band fades with the
  brightest line. While the line is open the window shows the last 8 lines
  whatever their age, then `SEND TO FRIENDLIES: text_` (the caret blinks twice
  a second; blue to All, green to the others) and a dim key hint. Colours are
  the message box's (`widgets::tone`), so the lobby and the flight agree:
  green `[116, 232, 124]` for a line from the reader's side to the side, the
  wing or the player; blue `[128, 176, 255]` to everyone from the reader's
  side or the lobby; red `[255, 118, 104]` from the other side whatever the
  receiver; pale grey `[214, 214, 208]` for the host's words. Retail's
  `MPSTATUS` pane and `MPFONT` are not used: the pane is an opaque 333 by 80
  black block that would hide a sixth of the top of the view.
- **Lines read** `YOU TO ALL: text` for the player's own and `VIPER TO WING:
  text` for another's (retail's `YOU TO ...` forms; retail shows only the
  sender's name on a line from another, the receiver here tells the player
  how it was meant); a line to the player's own plane as Target reads
  `VIPER TO YOU`.
- **The lobby's component** (`net/lobby_chat.rs`, placed by EF8): a
  `LobbyChat::new(messages_rect, field_at, width)` holding the kit's
  `MessageBox` and a plain grey `TextField` (80 characters, 18 high; John's
  2026-10-01 look for every field). `push` takes a `ChatLine` in its colour,
  `system` the screen's own words, `key` and `text_input` go to the line,
  `take_text` hands over the trimmed line for the screen to send to All, and
  `draw` draws both with the focus. A headless render in a mock panel is the
  ignored test `render_the_lobby_chat_in_a_mock_panel`.
- **The bot** (`Bot::say_at`, `quick_at`; `tore-bot --say SECONDS,RECEIVER,TEXT`
  and `--quick SECONDS,NUMBER`, both repeatable) sends its lines at their
  times after its first update, a line to anyone but All waiting until it
  flies, and prints every chat line it receives with the sender, the receiver
  and a sound.
- **Measured** (`client/chat_tests.rs`, synthetic resources on the simulator;
  the host's Target test chooses the designation through a test seam, since
  the synthetic import's radar sees nothing): routing for every receiver in
  the lobby and in flight (two sides, two wings, a target flown by a human
  and by the AI, no target, a player with no plane, a departed player), the
  limits, the quick messages and the system line back to the sender. A
  windowed run (a release game hosting with `--open-planes all`, a friendly
  `tore-bot` and an enemy one, the player's keys from an input script, through
  `tools/agent-run.sh`): the player opened the line with the backtick key,
  typed to All and to Friendlies, sent two quick messages (F9 with no
  target was refused by the host, F5 reached the friendly bot with its sound
  name), and received the bots' lines; each bot printed what it heard with
  its receiver (the friendly bot heard the player's lines to All and to
  Friendlies, the enemy bot only the line to All) and the game's log holds
  every line. Screenshots show the open line, a window with a line of each
  colour and a line fading out. Frame cost, 9000 frames at 1280 by 960
  with the bots silent and with each bot sending a line every 2 seconds (the
  window always full): UI composition 1.10 ms and 1.66 ms a frame on
  average, the frame interval 5.36 and 5.56 ms; the window's draw alone
  (`net::chat::tests::time_chat_draw`, release) takes 0.28 ms at 1280 by 960
  with six lines showing, 0.33 ms at 1920 by 1080 and 0.86 ms at 3840 by 2160, and
  0.42, 0.51 and 1.44 ms with the line open; with no lines it costs nothing.

### How stages E and F land

Two phases. The first is everything John's three-machine test needs; the
second, [phase 2](#phase-2-the-rest-of-stage-f), completes the plan's stage F.
Stage E's replays are designed and built apart, under
[recordings and diagnostics](#recordings-and-diagnostics).

**Phase 1: fly together.**

| Slice | Model | After | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EF0 Connection screens research | Sonnet | | Fold the retail survey into `docs/spec/multiplayer.md` and `docs/formats/menu.md`; settle the unknowns (NEWNET's field rectangles, the panel fonts, the list row count); the dialog reader learns `_DrawText`, a dialog's PIC name and a list's row count | Spec written with evidence; reader tests decode every network dialog. **Built (EF0, 2026-10-01):** the spec and format notes above, a headless render of NETWORK CONNECTION from the spec's numbers beside John's screenshot, and `ui::dialog` now reads text records (position, label, tail), a size-zero dialog's picture name, a list's row count, edit boxes and check boxes |
| EF1 Import the art | Sonnet | EF0 | The import keeps the multiplayer screens' pictures, pieces, fonts, dialogs and menus and the retail `CHAT.TXT`; a marker makes an older import ask to re-import | Single-player baseline SAME; an import holds every new name; an older pack asks for a re-import | **Built (EF1, 2026-10-01):** `selection.rs` lists `MULTIPLAYER_ART` (35 pictures) and `MULTIPLAYER_DATA` (26 dialogs and menus), about 1.4 MB; `CHAT.TXT` is read loose from an installed folder and from the disc container's DCL entry and kept as `TORE_CHAT_V1`, parsed by `tore_formats::chat`; the marker `TORE_MULTIPLAYER_V1` is written by every import and asked for by the game's pack check only (`check_multiplayer_marker`), not by the dedicated server's; the game's check reads every new picture, dialog and menu, and the game holds them in `Assets::multiplayer_resources`, not in `theater_resources`, whose contents the combat tapes fingerprint. What was left out and why: [menu format notes](formats/menu.md#what-the-import-keeps-for-these-screens-ef1-2026-10-01) |
| EF2 Widget kit | Sonnet | EF1 | Reusable retail-style widgets: text field, list with paging, scrolling message box, check box, the panel recipe, a background composed of two retail pictures, keyboard focus | Unit tests; headless renders compared with retail screenshots; single-player captures identical | **Built (EF2, 2026-10-01):** the kit is `crates/tore-app/src/widgets/` (how a screen uses it is the module's documentation): `Kit` (the pieces decoded in the screen's palette, the two backgrounds in their own), `draw_panel`, `Background` (`MODEM3` under `NETIPX3`'s top 77 rows until 2026-10-05, now `NETIPX3` alone with the player's title bar over its top 77 rows), `Button` (with the disabled default from `ACTDFD0*`; the default button keeps its outline all round but not the cap's striped box, ghosted text is 1.275 times as bright, and the screens' text is drawn sharp at the window's resolution over the canvas, see [Sharp text](formats/menu.md#sharp-text-2026-10-05), John 2026-10-05), `TextField` (filters for callsign, address and port; `parse_address`; EF8: the plain grey box only, 13 high as a `bar` or 18 as a `line`, John 2026-10-01; EF2 had retail's red edit control as well, now removed), `List` (rows, columns, icons, rocker, "PAGE n of m"), `MessageBox`, `CheckBox`, `Focus`. No screen uses it yet and `main.rs` routing is unchanged: widgets take the key names and text the screens already receive. Agent decisions: the focus mark is a dotted pale rectangle that shows once the keyboard has been used; an empty list's page box reads `1  of  0` and its PREV and NEXT stay bright as on John's screenshot (they dim only at the ends of a list with rows); the selected row carries `LISTHI`'s gold stripe as a marker and the selection always stays on the shown page; the lock, crown and ready tick are authored pixel pictures (retail has none); the message box wraps with a two space hanging indent, keeps 200 lines, scrolls by wheel and keys and shows a thin bar when lines are hidden; buttons keep the existing pieces but label in `FONTACT`/`FONTDFT` as NEWNET does. A mock NETWORK CONNECTION built only of kit widgets is the same picture as EF0's render of the spec's numbers (0 of 307,200 pixels differ); drawing it whole (background, panel, three lists, a message box, two fields, a check box and four buttons) costs about 0.54 ms a frame in a release build and 1.1 ms in the dev build on this machine, of which the widgets are 0.31 ms and the rest the 640 by 480 background and panel; building the kit takes about 150 ms once, when a screen opens (the ignored tests in `widgets/mock_screen.rs`, 500 runs each) 
| EF3 Host in the game | Opus | | **Built.** The host on a thread inside the game, the in-process link, the local client, lifecycle and the game's 120 Hz clock | A hosted mission with a bot flies with no correction on the host's own plane; a two-second window stall stalls nobody; the session ends cleanly on leave, quit and a host panic |
| EF4 The lobby on the wire | Opus | EF3 | The host's lobby phase, slots, loadouts, ready and start, the King's mission, return to the lobby after a mission, the crown, kick; the dedicated server's lobby without a King; protocol version 3 | Simulator tests: players join a lobby, take slots, arm, ready, start, fly, return and fly again; the King's mission change reaches everyone; the wire golden test. **Built (EF4):** see [the lobby](#the-lobby); the crown stays the hosting player's (passing it is phase 2) |
| EF5 Discovery and addresses | Sonnet | EF4 | The discovery query and answer, the search loop, names resolved off the screen's thread with every address tried, remembered addresses | A host is found on 127.0.0.1 and on this machine's network address; a different build is shown as such; no answer is larger than its query. **Built (EF5):** see [finding a game and joining](#finding-a-game-and-joining) |
| EF6 Chat | Sonnet | EF4 | Chat on the wire with the host's routing, the lobby's box and line, the flight line and keys, the top-left chat window with its colours, `CHAT.TXT` quick messages, limits; `docs/CONTROLS.md` | Routing tests for every receiver; a windowed run types and receives chat in flight with a bot; the controls list test. **Built (EF6):** see [chat](#chat) |
| EF7 Direct Connection screen | Sonnet | EF2, EF5 | The MULTI menu's rows and the screen of "Finding a game and joining" | Headless renders; a windowed run finds a host on this machine and joins it. **Built (EF7):** see [the Direct Connection screen as built](#the-direct-connection-screen-as-built-ef7) |
| EF8 Lobby screen | Sonnet | EF2, EF4, EF6 | The lobby screen, the creator with Accept, Load Ordnance for one's own slot, the debrief and the return | A windowed run hosts, builds a mission, takes a slot, chats with a bot, starts, flies, ends and returns to the lobby. **Built (EF8):** see [the lobby screen as built](#the-lobby-screen-as-built-ef8) |
| EF9 Acceptance | lead, then John | all | The lead's smoke test on this machine (a hosting game, a joining game, a bot); then John on three machines (macOS, Linux, Windows) | John flies with friends from the menus. **Passed 2026-10-05:** John ran it on macOS, Linux and Windows and reports it works (protocol 7 builds; his hands-on report, no logs or figures kept) |
| EF-K Keepalive | Opus | EF6 | A joined game whose loop is stalled is kept connected by a keepalive thread, under the connection's own identity, for at most a minute; protocol version 5 | A joined client stalled 15 seconds is not dropped and recovers; one stalled past the bound is dropped; a keepalive from elsewhere keeps nothing alive; the King is unaffected. **Built (EF-K):** see [a stalled game stays connected](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k) |
| EF-X CI on macOS and Windows | Opus | EF-K | Find and fix every macOS and Windows failure of `ci.yml` and `network.yml`, real platform behaviour or over-strict tests | One CI run green on all jobs; each system's game-port behaviour written down. **Built (EF-X):** see [the game port on each system](#the-game-port-on-each-system-ef-x) and [sleep and wait accuracy on each system](#sleep-and-wait-accuracy-on-each-system-ef-x); the macOS golden fingerprints were recorded again, Windows checkouts' CR LF line ends are read, and the real-time tests judge what a slow runner cannot change |
| EF-M A Mac host on time | Opus | EF-X | A Mach time-constraint policy on the game's host thread and `tore-server`'s loop, and an `NSProcessInfo` latency-critical activity while hosting, in a new native crate | The macOS runners' figures with the fix beside EF-X's; `ci.yml` and `network.yml` green; single-player baseline SAME. **Built (EF-M):** see [sleep and wait accuracy on each system](#sleep-and-wait-accuracy-on-each-system-ef-x) and the crate `tore-realtime-native` |
| EF-F Smoke-test fixes | Sonnet | EF9 | What the lead's smoke test found: a player who ended its own flight is seated again (it was stuck in the lobby), a networked debrief says how the mission ended instead of "MISSION FAILURE", a server's kick says "The server", the net log and the screen say the same words, a game just left is not listed as Closed, the lobby's cheat notice covers no label, and a `stall SECONDS` input-script step | Tests for each; a windowed run of host, joiner and bot: leave and rejoin twice, an 8 second stall that keeps the joiner connected, the debrief headlines, a server's kick wording. **Built (EF-F):** see [smoke-test fixes](#smoke-test-fixes-ef-f) |
| EF-Y Reliable real-time tests | Opus | EF-M | Make the real-time tests reliable on the CI runners (the 8 and 2 second stalls, the lookup, the hosted mission on 32-bit Windows, the diagnostics WouldBlock), fixing real defects if any | Three consecutive green `ci.yml` runs and a green `network.yml`; single-player baseline SAME. **Built (EF-Y):** see [real-time tests on shared runners](#real-time-tests-on-shared-runners-ef-y) |

EF0 and EF3 start together. EF7 and EF8 both edit the menus and `main.rs`, so
they run one after the other.

#### Phase 2: the rest of stage F

Design for the rest of stage F, written by a design agent on 2026-10-05 for the
lead's run through Milestone 2. Stage E's last piece, captures converted to
smoothed replays, is designed and built apart, under
[recordings and diagnostics](#recordings-and-diagnostics). Everything below is
an *agent proposal* unless it is credited to John; his binding decisions are the
guide's [decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions). The questions that are John's to
answer are listed at the end of this subsection with a recommendation each, and
the design builds as written if he takes the recommendations.

In short:

- **The King's settings** are one numbered list, kept by the host, shown to
  every player in the lobby state, changed only by the King and checked by the
  host. A dedicated server takes the same list from its configuration file.
- **The crown and the house come apart.** The King runs the lobby and can pass
  the crown; the house is the machine that runs the host. The house leaving
  still ends a game a player hosts (until stage K's migration); the King
  leaving passes the crown on.
- **Death and revival** are two new mission commands: a lost plane is
  abandoned to the mission, and a revival either takes a free AI aircraft or
  spawns a new aircraft of the same type at the revival distance from the
  battle, with retail's revival weapons. The host counts lives and the delay.
- **Scoring** is mission facts recorded by the mission core (who killed whom,
  with which pilot aboard; damage; losses) and tallies, limits and the end kept
  by the host. A kill limit ends the mission as a time limit does.
- **The results** at the end list every aircraft, human and AI, and, in PvP,
  the scores, as new pages of the debrief.
- **Friend or foe:** the lock box's X follows the viewer's side, U squawks IFF,
  and Show Target Info labels aircraft, with a human's callsign beneath.
- **Human wingmen** hear their leader's orders as a radio call and text, and
  answer with four reply keys.
- **Observers** get a snapshot stream with no plane of their own, optionally
  delayed in PvP, watched through the replay viewer in a live mode.
- **An idle player's aircraft** goes to the AI after a King's setting of 10
  seconds away (menu, focus, stall) and comes back at the first control input.
- **A dedicated server can have a King**, when its configuration says so.
- Single player does not change, apart from three retail features it gains
  only if John agrees (question 2).

##### Where each rule lives

The mission core keeps what the simulation must decide the same way on every
machine, and what a checkpoint (stage H) must carry; the host session keeps the
people (players, the crown, lives, tallies); the screens only show and ask.

| Rule | Mission core (`tore-world`, `tore-sim`) | Host session (`tore-session`) | Screens (`tore-app`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sides | Each plane's side, fixed at setup (built) | Which sides humans may take (mode), lock sides | Slots list by side |
| Friendly fire | `MissionSpec::friendly_fire`, put on combat's `State::friendly_fire` at the build (the rule is built: B1) | The King's setting, written into the spec it sends | Settings panel |
| Loadout rule | `LoadoutSpec::check_for_plane` takes the rule | The King's setting; checks each loadout | Load Ordnance's Cheat loading enabled or refused |
| Realism | The spec's cheats (built) | The King's mission change | Settings panel's Realism page edits the mission |
| Death | A plane is lost: destroyed, pilot dead or ejected (`World::can_take` refuses it, built) | Notices the seat's loss, starts the delay | Revival prompt |
| Revival | `MissionCommand::Abandon` and `Revive`; the revival point; the weapons rule | Respawn rule, lives, delay; picks the AI plane or asks for a spawn | Enter to fly again |
| Scoring | Score facts each tick (kills with the pilots aboard, damage, losses) | Tallies by player and side, limits, the winner, the end | In-flight score board, SCORES page |
| Results | `debrief::results`: a row for every plane | Adds callsigns and scores, sends Results | RESULTS pages |
| Orders and replies | The order call to human wingmen; reply calls | Nothing new (seat commands) | Reply keys |
| Friend or foe | Nothing new | Nothing new | The X, IFF, labels, from the client's copy of the mission |
| Observers | Nothing new | The observer stream and its delay | The viewer in live mode |
| Idle aircraft | Handoff (built) | Away and back, the reservation, the setting | Away detection, the banner |
| The crown | Nothing | King, house, passing, a server's King | Players panel |

##### The King's settings

The settings are numbered (the wire carries a number and a value, as the lobby
state's placeholder already does) and live in one registry,
`tore_session::settings`, which holds each one's number, text name, values,
defaults, when it may change and its check. The host, the dedicated server's
configuration file, the lobby screen and the logs all read it, so a setting is
added in one place. Values the retail host dialogs offered are kept where they
are known; the rows of the `MC_*` dialogs are unknown
([retail spec](spec/multiplayer.md#the-hosts-mission-setting-dialogs)), so the
choices below are fitted to retail's ranges ([numbers](spec/multiplayer.md#numbers)).

| No. | Name | Values | Default, co-op | Default, PvP | The King changes it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `mode` | `co-op` (humans on the friendly side), `pvp` (humans on either side) | co-op | pvp | In the lobby |
| 2 | `max-players` | 1 to 30 | 30, or the server's | same | Any time, never below the players connected |
| 3 | `join-in-progress` | `off`, `on` | on | on | Any time |
| 4 | `visibility` | `hidden` (join by address only), `local` (answer the local network's search), `public` (also listed on the Internet Lobby; a game a player hosts only, built in F2-1) | local | local | Any time |
| 5 | `password` | set or not (the text travels only in the King's request, never in the lobby state) | not set | not set | Any time; applies to the next joins |
| 6 | `friendly-fire` | `off`, `on` | on | on | In the lobby |
| 7 | `lock-sides` | `off`, `on` | off | on | In the lobby |
| 8 | `loadouts` | `own` (what each aircraft really carries), `any` (any store on any station, the loadout page's Cheat) | own | own | In the lobby |
| 9 | `respawn` | `none`, `ai-slot` (take a free AI aircraft of one's side), `revive` (retail's revival: a new aircraft out of the battle) | none | revive | In the lobby |
| 10 | `lives` | 0 to 10, `unlimited` | unlimited | unlimited | In the lobby |
| 11 | `revive-delay` | 0 to 5 minutes, whole minutes | 0 | 0 | In the lobby |
| 12 | `revive-distance` | 1, 5, 10, 20 or 40 nautical miles | 10 | 10 | In the lobby |
| 13 | `revive-weapons` | `missiles`, `no-missiles` (keeps air-to-ground missiles), `guns`, `half-guns` | missiles | missiles | In the lobby |
| 14 | `fight` | `sides`, `free-for-all` | sides | sides | In the lobby |
| 15 | `tally` | `kills`, `damage`, `ratio` | kills | kills | In the lobby |
| 16 | `time-limit` | none, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes | none | 10 | In the lobby |
| 17 | `kill-limit` | none, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or 10 | none | 5 | In the lobby |
| 18 | `kill-owner` | `total`, `side`, `player` | side | side | In the lobby |
| 19 | `observer-delay` | 0, 10, 30 or 60 seconds; PvP only | 0 | 0 | In the lobby |
| 20 | `idle-ai` | `never`, 1, 2, 5 or 10 minutes away (60, 120, 300 or 600 seconds on the wire) | 5 minutes | 5 minutes | Any time |

- **Changing the mode** sets every other setting to the new mode's defaults,
  as the creator's own choices reset what depends on them; the King then
  adjusts. *Built (F2-0), agent decision:* "every other" is every setting the
  King changes in the lobby; the ones changed any time (players, join in
  progress, visibility, password, idle aircraft) belong to the game and are
  kept, as are the name and the password (`settings::Store::apply`). Settings 14 to 19 are greyed in co-op except the time limit, which
  ends a co-op mission too (the dedicated server's `time-limit` is this
  setting).
- **A change in the lobby** that alters what players chose (mode, lock
  sides, loadouts, a slot lock) clears every ready mark, as a mission change
  does; any other change keeps them. A change refused for its phase says
  "Change it in the lobby, between missions."
- **The game's name** is a text setting beside the numbers, changed any time.
- **Realism** stays the mission's own cheats (John's spec: inherited from the
  Quick Mission settings and locked for every human). The Settings panel's
  Realism page edits the lobby mission's cheats and sends it as a mission
  change; nothing changes the mission's cheats in flight, so every client's
  prediction keeps running the same rules. *This replaces the earlier gap-fill*
  in the guide that gave the King the Cheat menu in flight (question 6).
- **Stage I and K settings** are not here: what `public` does on the master
  server is stage I's (its design lists a game when the hosting thread is told
  `SetListed`, which this setting drives), and the pinned or calculated host
  and releasing a reserved aircraft are stage K's. Retail's in-flight Multi menu handicaps (reduce bullet accuracy and
  the rest, [retail](spec/multiplayer.md#retail-connection-screens)) are not in
  phase 2.

##### The King, the crown and the house

EF4 made the King the hosting player's own connection and its leaving the end
of the game. Phase 2 separates the two roles the guide already names:

- **The house** is the connection of the player whose game runs the host (the
  in-process link's address in a hosted game; none on a dedicated server). It is
  the one exempt from the silence timeout, and its leaving ends the game for
  everyone, as EF4 built it, until stage K migrates the host.
  `HostConfig::king` becomes `HostConfig::house`, and the King is a lobby role.
- **The King** is a player. In a hosted game it starts as the house. **Pass
  the crown** (message 23, the King only) gives it to another connected player.
  A King who leaves, or is dropped, passes it to the longest-connected player
  (in a hosted game that is the house). The King's Leave asks "Leaving ends
  the game for everyone." only of the house; a King who is not the house is
  told "The crown passes to Hawk."
- **Only the King** changes the mission and the settings, locks slots, starts
  and ends the mission, kicks and passes the crown (EF4's refusal "Only the
  King may do that." stands). The house without the crown is an ordinary player
  but for leaving.
- **A dedicated server** keeps no King by default. Its configuration's new
  `king first-player` gives the crown to the first player to join and then to
  the longest-connected; the server's start rule becomes the King's while a
  King is connected. `king-mission locked` refuses the King's mission changes
  (the file's mission and its settings stay; start, kick and the crown still
  work). When the last player leaves, the server waits out its empty timeout
  and goes back to its file's mission and settings, so a public server does not
  keep a stranger's choices.

##### Slots, sides and joining

- **Mode.** Co-op makes every friendly plane a slot (EF4's default); PvP makes
  every plane of both sides one, and the lobby lists them by side. The
  dedicated server's `open-planes` stays its own rule when it has no King.
- **Slot locks** (message 27, the King only): each slot is `open`, `closed`
  (the AI flies it; nobody takes it, the lead included) or `reserved` for one
  callsign (only that player takes it). A lock that removes a player's slot
  frees it and tells the player. The lobby state carries each slot's lock.
- **Join in progress off** refuses every seating after the mission's first
  tick, except a player's own revival: "This game takes no new pilots once the
  mission flies." Players in the lobby watch instead. On, the EF4 rules stand.
- **Lock sides** keeps each player on the side of the first plane it flew in
  this mission: taking a plane or a revival on the other side is refused, "Sides
  are locked until the mission ends."
- **Max players** lowers or raises the capacity the handshake checks (the
  lesser of it and the open slots, as built); the password and the visibility
  apply to the next joins and the next search answers: `hidden` answers no
  search, `local` answers the local network's, and the lock shows whenever a
  password is set.

##### Loadout rule, friendly fire and realism

- `LoadoutSpec::check_for_plane` takes the loadout rule. Under `any`, the
  Cheat loading the page offers is allowed and checked by the page's own cheat
  rules; under `own`, EF4's refusal stands. Changing the rule to `own` drops a
  kept cheat loadout to the standard load with a Notice, as a mission change
  does.
- `MissionSpec` gains `friendly_fire` (text form `friendly-fire on/off`, on
  when absent, refused off in a single-player spec), which the build puts on
  combat's setting. Single player's spec never carries it, so its build is
  unchanged.

##### The King's lobby as built (F2-1)

*Built (F2-1, 2026-10-05).* `host/king.rs` holds the crown, the settings'
phase rules, slot locks and the King's rules on taking a plane; the house is
`HostConfig::house` and the crown's rule `HostConfig::crown`
(`CrownRule::FirstPlayer` in a game a player hosts and on a server with `king
first-player`). Each choice below is an agent decision unless it says
otherwise.

- **The crown.** The house wears it when it joins; with no house, the first
  player to join does. A King who leaves passes it to the longest-connected
  player ("Hawk wears the crown" in the log); a King who passes it is logged
  "Viper passed the crown to Hawk". Passing it to oneself is refused "You wear
  the crown already.", to a player who has gone "There is no such player.".
  The King may not kick the house, whose leaving would end the game: "The
  house runs the game; it cannot be kicked." The lobby state's house id is
  the house's; a server has none.
- **A change of settings** is checked whole before anything applies: the
  registry's words; "Change it in the lobby, between missions." for a lobby
  setting while the mission is not in the lobby (its short ended phase
  counts as not); "kill-limit applies only in PvP." for a PvP setting while
  the mode, as the change leaves it, is co-op; the player limit's floor ("2
  players are connected: the limit cannot be lower.") and its ceiling, the
  configuration's `max-players` ("This game takes at most 12 players.");
  `public` where the game cannot be listed; a name of 1 to 64 bytes and a
  password of printable text. The log line names every change: "Viper
  changed the settings: mode pvp, kill-limit 3, name "Night owls", password
  set".
- **Friendly fire and the loadout rule** travel in the mission
  (`MissionSpec::friendly_fire`, text `friendly-fire off`;
  `MissionSpec::cheat_loadouts`, text `loadouts any`; neither written at its
  default, so single player's text is unchanged), so every player's copy
  builds the same rules. The host writes them from its settings into every
  mission it builds: the King's own mission text and a server's file are
  overruled by the settings. A change of either builds the lobby's mission
  again and sends it again *under the same number*, so the requests already
  made for it still stand; a kept loadout the new rule refuses drops to the
  standard load with a Notice. The build puts friendly fire on combat's
  setting, which combat keeps across its restarts; single player's build
  refuses both lines. `LoadoutSpec::check_in` checks a loadout under the
  mission's rule (a Cheat loading by the page's cheat capacities under
  `any`); `check_for_plane` keeps the `own` rule for the lobby screen until
  slice F2-L.
- **Mode and slots.** `open-planes friendly`, the default, now means the
  mode's planes: the friendly ones in co-op, every plane in PvP; `all` and a
  list stay as given in either mode. A mode change frees every held slot that
  is no longer one, with a Notice, drops its lock, and clears every ready
  mark, as a change of lock sides or of the loadout rule does.
- **Slot locks** apply in any phase and bind the next take: a player flying
  a plane whose slot is closed flies on, and only its slot in the lobby
  goes. A closed slot leaves the handshake's capacity. When the King changes
  the mission a lock stays on a plane that is still a slot of the same
  aircraft, as a kept loadout does. Refusals: "Plane 3 is closed: the AI
  flies it.", "Plane 3 is kept for Hawk."; "any free slot" skips both. The
  player who loses a slot reads "The King closed plane 3's slot: the AI
  flies it." or "The King keeps plane 3's slot for Hawk."
- **Join in progress off** refuses every seating after the mission's first
  tick, a player who left its own plane included: "This game takes no new
  pilots once the mission flies." A player ready in the lobby flies the next
  mission.
- **Lock sides** keeps each player's side by callsign (a player who leaves and
  joins again keeps it) from the first plane it flies in a mission, until the
  next start. `Host::sides_refusal` is the check for slice F2-V's revival,
  which is not a new pilot.
- **Players, password, visibility.** The handshake reads the player limit and
  the password from the settings, and the discovery answer the name and the
  lock; `hidden` answers no search. An observer still counts against the
  room, as F2-O1 built it, so a full game takes no observer: a place in the
  lobby is a place, and the King raises the limit or opens a slot for one.
- **Visibility and the listing.** A game a player hosts
  (`HostConfig::listable`) takes `public`: its hosting thread follows the
  setting as it follows `Command::SetListed`, listing the game when the
  setting turns public and taking it off when it turns local or hidden; only
  a change counts. A game hosted without a listing gets one then, on the
  public master and with no statistics; a game hosted to be listed starts
  public. A dedicated server refuses `public`: its listing is its operator's
  `broadcast`.
- **A server's King** (John's decision, 2026-10-05). `king first-player` gives
  the crown as above; while a King is connected the start rule is the King's
  (the lobby state says so), and without one it is the file's again. `king-mission
  locked` refuses the King's mission and settings ("This server's mission and
  settings are its operator's."); start, kick, slot locks and the crown
  still work. Once the last player has been gone for the server's
  `empty-timeout`, in the lobby, it goes back to its file's mission, settings
  and open slots ("The server has been empty for its empty timeout: back to
  its file's mission and settings").
- **The time limit** a King sets is one of the registry's; a server's file
  gives any whole minute up to 10,080 (a week), which the store and the lobby
  state carry as given (F2-0's decision, kept) until the King changes it or a
  mode change resets it.
- **Watching** is logged when it starts and stops ("Owl is watching the
  mission", "Owl stopped watching"), the note F2-O1 left.

##### Death, revival and lives

**When a plane is lost.** A human's plane is lost when it is destroyed or its
pilot is dead or has ejected, the same test `World::can_take` already makes.
The seat keeps the wreck until the player flies again or leaves. Retail's
player "presses Enter to re-enter the battle".

**Two mission commands** (`tore-world`, applied first in the tick with Take and
GiveBack):

- `MissionCommand::Abandon { seat }` frees the seat from its lost plane. The
  plane's pilot becomes `Pilot::Lost`: its cockpit goes on stepping inside the
  world with a paused game's neutral controls (wreck motion, the escape), as the
  host's departed-player orphans do today, which this replaces. Nobody can take
  it.
- `MissionCommand::Revive { seat, spawn }` abandons the seat's lost plane and
  seats it in a **new plane**: the next plane id after every plane the mission
  has had, in the old plane's wing with the next free member number, the same
  aircraft, at the spawn's position, heading and speed, with the spawn's
  loadout and full fuel. It is built as the mission builds an AI aircraft with
  a lobby loadout (`plane_loadouts`), then taken by the existing handoff, so
  every rule of the handoff holds. A `Spawned` message tells every client, whose
  copy of the mission adds the same plane, so the roster, the sides and the
  aircraft types know it.

**The revival point** (`world::revive::point`, fitted: retail says only "just
outside the battle zone at the host's revival distance"). The battle's centre
is the mean position of the living aircraft that have an aircraft of the other
side within 20 nm, or of every living aircraft if none has. The new plane is
placed on the bearing from that centre towards the mean start position of its
side's wings, at the revival distance from the centre, at the mission's
airborne start altitude, heading for the centre, at its aircraft's airborne
start speed.

**The weapons rule** (`world::revive::revival_loadout`), applied to the loadout
the player chose in the lobby (or the standard load): `missiles` keeps it whole;
`no-missiles` empties every air-to-air missile station and keeps air-to-ground
missiles, bombs and the gun; `guns` keeps the gun alone; `half-guns` keeps the
gun with half its rounds, rounded up. The same rule cuts an AI aircraft's
stores when the `ai-slot` rule hands one over.

**The host's part** (`host/revive.rs`):

- The respawn rule: `none` (the player watches until the mission ends),
  `ai-slot` (a free AI plane of the player's side open to it, its own wing
  first, then the side's other wings, lowest id first; Abandon then Take, with
  the weapons rule), or `revive` (Revive with a point and a loadout).
- **Lives** count revivals, per player per mission, reset at the next mission.
  **The delay** counts from the moment the plane was lost.
- A seat whose plane is lost is sent **Revival** (message 29): its lives left,
  the seconds until it may fly again, and the rule. The flight's HUD says "Press
  Enter to fly again (2 lives left)", "You can fly again in 0:45", or "No lives
  left. Esc, then Watch, shows the battle." Enter sends **Revive** (message 28);
  the answer is a new Seated (a new [flight](formats/net-protocol.md#flights))
  or a refusal in words.
- **Joining from the lobby** after a loss counts as a revival: the same rule,
  lives and delay apply, so leaving and pressing Join cannot dodge them (this
  changes EF-F's free rejoin for a player whose plane was lost).
- **Room.** A mission holds at most 64 planes at once (the wire's aircraft in
  a snapshot). A revival that would pass it first retires the oldest lost plane
  whose wreck has rested on the ground for 30 seconds: it leaves combat, the
  snapshots and the roster message, and keeps its ledger entries and its
  results row. With none to retire the revival waits and the HUD says so.

*Built (F2-V, 2026-10-05).* The mission core's part is `world/revive.rs`, the
host's `host/revive.rs`, the client's `client/revival.rs`, the bot's `tore-bot
--revive SECONDS` and the game's prompt and Enter in `net/play.rs`. What the
build settled, each an agent decision unless the design above says it:

- **Lost** is the handoff's own test (`World::plane_lost`): crashed or
  destroyed, or the pilot dead, ejected or escaping, the test that refuses
  giving such a plane back to the AI.
- **An abandoned plane** keeps its cockpit and its ownship. The step gives it a
  paused game's neutral input addressed to the seat `revive::NOBODY` (255, a
  seat no host gives out), so its cues reach nobody; its tower and crew voice
  are silent. A destroyed plane's wreck falls on and an ejected pilot's
  parachute comes down as before.
- **The seat keeps the wreck while its player stays.** A player who leaves its
  flight with a lost plane goes back to the lobby while the host *holds* its
  seat: the wreck flies on with neutral input and the roster still names the
  player. A player who leaves the game, is dropped or is kicked has its lost
  plane abandoned (`MissionCommand::Abandon`). This replaces the departed
  players' orphans, and a held or abandoned plane is refused to anyone else
  ("Plane 0 is destroyed or has lost its pilot.").
- **The new plane** takes the next id (one past every plane the mission has
  had, retired ones included, and past any combat row) and the next member of
  the old plane's wing (one past the wing's highest). Its combat row is made
  as the mission's other aircraft are and given that id; the AI aircraft is
  built as an AI aircraft with a lobby loadout is (the stores, fuel and
  payload, fresh sensors from its configuration's profiles, the flares and
  chaff its configuration fills, a wingmate's skill or Average when its side
  has no AI aircraft left), then taken by the handoff. `World::add_plane`
  makes the same plane in a client's copy.
- **The loadout** names its weapons; the mission core takes each record from
  the configurations the mission already holds (the standard loads, the AI's,
  the humans'), since the world keeps no import. The base is the player's
  lobby loadout when its slot is the same aircraft, else the standard load; a
  lobby loadout that no longer resolves gives way to the standard load. Full
  fuel is the aircraft's internal capacity. An **air-to-air missile** for
  `no-missiles` is what the retail debrief counts as one (guided, against
  aircraft); the creator's Guns only still empties every station but the gun.
- **The revival point** measures distances horizontally. The altitude is the
  mission's launch altitude, raised clear of the ground by the rule the
  mission's airborne spawns follow (5,000 ft above sea level, 1,000 ft above
  the ground); the speed is the aircraft's flight model start airspeed. Each
  side's start is the mean position of its aircraft when the mission starts
  flying, which the host records. With nobody alive the centre is the start;
  a start on the centre places the plane due south, heading north.
- **Retiring.** A wreck rests once it has crashed, its wreck no longer falls
  and its pilot's escape is over; the oldest is the first abandoned. A
  retired plane's cockpit, ownship and roster entry go and
  `revive::Book::retired` keeps the entry for the results.
- **Lives and the delay** are kept by the player's join order, as the scores
  are, and start afresh each mission; a player who leaves the game and joins
  again is a new player until stage K's rejoin.
- **Asking.** Revive (in flight, or from the lobby with a held seat) and Join
  after a loss are answered at the next tick. Their refusals are "The mission
  is not flying.", "Your aircraft is not lost.", "No revival in this game.",
  "No lives left.", "You can fly again in 0:45.", and "No AI aircraft of your
  side is free."; Revive's come as a Refused, Join's as a Seat refused. With
  no room the revival waits and the player is sent Revival once more with
  "Waiting for room for another aircraft.".
- **`ai-slot`** abandons the lost plane and takes the chosen aircraft for the
  same seat in one tick. The host cuts the aircraft's stores by the weapons
  rule just before the take (`World::cut_ai_stores`, a change between ticks
  as the scoring switch is; a checkpoint carries it as the AI's station
  rounds). Its choice skips a slot the King closed or kept for someone else
  and an aircraft lock sides refuses (F2-1's `lock_refusal` and
  `sides_refusal`); a revival is never a new pilot, so join in progress off
  does not refuse it. A `revive` revival keeps the lost plane's wing, and is
  checked against lock sides the same way.
- **Spawned** goes to every connection (a delayed observer's through
  `send_as_of`) before the player's Seated, and a player who joins later is
  sent every spawned plane still in the mission after the Mission and Roster
  messages. A revival's plane is its player's: it does not raise the
  players a host can seat.
- **The game.** The client keeps the newest Revival and counts its wait down
  (`Client::revival`, `revival_prompt`, `may_fly_again`) and adds each
  spawned plane to its copy (`Client::spawned`). In flight the HUD says the
  prompt again every five seconds and when the player may fly again; Enter is
  the visual designation key's binding, which flies again after a loss and
  designates otherwise. A Seated while flying puts the flight away and starts
  the new one, as a player who joins again does, and every copy of the
  mission the game builds gets the spawned planes.

##### Scoring

Retail's rules ([numbers](spec/multiplayer.md#numbers)): only aircraft and
helicopters count; killing a human player before he ejects counts as two kills;
the tallies are total kills, total damage delivered to opponents, or the kill
ratio; the time limit and kill limit end the game; the kill owner says who must
reach the kill limit.

- **Facts in the mission core** (`tore-world`, `score.rs`). When the host
  turns scoring on (`World::set_scoring(true)`; single player never does, so
  its tick and fingerprint are untouched), each tick records, from the
  ledger's new kills and combat's strikes: `Kill` (shooter plane and its pilot,
  victim plane and its pilot, an aircraft or not, the pilot still aboard),
  `Damage` (shooter, victim, the hit's fraction of the victim's full hit
  points) and `Loss` (a human's plane lost, by any cause). The host drains them
  every tick. Combat's `Strike` gains the damage amount for this.
- **Tallies in the host** (`host/score.rs`), by player: kills (two for a human
  victim with the pilot aboard, one otherwise; aircraft only), damage to
  opponents (in aircraft: a whole aircraft's hit points is 1.0), losses, and the
  ratio (kills over losses, kills alone with no loss). A kill is credited to the
  player flying the shooter's plane at the kill's tick; a lost plane's late
  missile credits the player who flew it; an AI shooter scores nothing.
  Opponents are the other side's aircraft under `sides`, and every aircraft
  but one's own under `free-for-all` (the AI on one's own side does not count;
  `free-for-all` changes the scoring only, never who can hit whom).
- **Limits.** The kill limit is reached when the kills of every player together
  (`total`), of one side's players (`side`) or of one player (`player`) reach
  it. The mission then ends with the new reason **kill limit**, as the time
  limit ends it, with the winner by the tally: a side under `sides`, a player
  under `free-for-all`, or a draw.
- **Scores** (message 31) go to every player whenever they change, at most
  once a second, and with the end. In flight **K** opens and closes the score
  board, retail's Show Player Scores open to every player (the guide's
  gap-fill): one of retail's three headings, PLAYERS RANKED BY KILLS, KILL
  RATIO or TOTAL DAMAGE, the players in order with their side, and the time
  left.

*Built (F2-S, 2026-10-05).* What the build settled, each an agent decision
unless the design above says it:

- **Recording.** `tore_world::score::Recorder` lives on the world while
  scoring is on (`World::score`, `None` in single player). It runs after
  combat and the AI, before the radio drains combat's strikes, and only
  reads: combat's `Strike` gained `amount` (the hit points the hit took) and
  `State::strikes` reads the tick's strikes in place. A **kill** is recorded
  when a plane of the roster becomes lost by the handoff's own test (crashed,
  no hit points, pilot dead or escaped), credited as the debrief credits a
  loss: combat's kill, else the last plane to hit it; a plane whose last hit
  was its own, a crash with no hit and a plane lost out of bounds credit
  nobody. `pilot_aboard` is false only when the pilot escaped first, so a
  plane shot down and then ejected from counts as killed with its pilot
  aboard. Any other target a hit destroys (a ground object) is a kill with
  `aircraft` false. Each target's end is recorded once: the set of recorded
  targets is the recorder's only state between ticks.
- **Tallies.** The host keeps them by connection (its join order, never
  reused), so a lobby id given out again starts afresh; a player who leaves
  leaves the list, and what it scored stays in its side's tally. A side's
  tally is its players' only: the AI scores nothing, for its side either.
  Kills and damage count against opponents only; a kill of one's own side
  takes nothing away (retail's penalty, if any, is unknown).
- **Co-op.** Scores go out in co-op too, so K works there, but the scoring
  settings that are greyed in co-op do not apply: no kill limit, the fight by
  sides, and no winner.
- **The winner** is named only when a limit (kills or time) ends a PvP
  mission; a mission ended any other way sends its final scores with none.
  Players rank by the tally, then kills, then damage, then joining order; a
  free-for-all whose best two are level is a draw.
- **Scores** go to seated players and observers: whenever the tallies or
  the listed players and sides change, at most once every 120 ticks, and to
  a newly seated player or new observer at the next of those chances. An
  observer watching with a delay gets them once its stream shows their tick
  (F2-O1's `send_as_of`). At the end every connection gets the final scores
  at once, before the observers' watches end, Results and Mission ended.
- **The time limit** the host ends a mission at is now the settings store's
  (`time-limit`, which starts as the configuration's), so the King's change
  applies.
- **The client** keeps the newest Scores (`Client::scores`) and counts the
  time left down from its arrival (`Client::seconds_left`); a new mission or
  a flight's start clears them. Each one is a `scores` line in the game's net
  log, and `tore-bot` prints it (`NAME: scores: ...`, the words of
  `tore_session::client::scores::summary`).
- **The board** (`tore-app` `net/scoreboard.rs`, fitted: retail's layout is
  unknown): K opens and closes it in a networked flight, and it closes with
  each new flight. It is drawn in the HUD's font over a translucent band, 360
  layer units wide and centred, from 96 units down: the heading, a row for
  each player (rank, callsign, side, kills, losses, damage in aircraft, ratio)
  in the colours of the chat window (the viewer's side green, the other red,
  no side yet grey, the viewer's own row gold), each side's totals when the
  fight is by sides, the kill limit and the time left, and the winner once
  there is one. Before the first message it says "Waiting for the scores".

##### The multiplayer debrief

`tore_world::debrief::results(&World)` gives a row for every plane the mission
had, retired planes included, from the same `Ending::pilot` rule each seat's
report uses: status, damage, kills by the ten rows summed, friendly fire,
air-to-air and gun shots and hits. The host adds each row's pilot (a callsign,
or AI, and every callsign that flew it), the scores and the winner, and sends
**Results** (message 32) to every connection at the mission's end, observers
and players in the lobby included.

The debrief keeps the retail pages for the player's own plane and, in a
networked game, adds after the first page: **SCORES** (PvP only: the winner,
the ranking with each player's kills, losses, damage and ratio) and
**RESULTS** (every aircraft by side and wing, fifteen to a page:
callsign or AI, aircraft, status, kills, hit percentage, damage). Single
player's debrief is unchanged: the pages appear only with a Results message.

*Built (F2-D, 2026-10-05).* What the build settled, each an agent decision
unless the design above says it:

- **The rows** are `tore_world::debrief::results(&World)`: one
  `PlaneResult` for every plane of the roster and every retired wreck, from
  the same `Ending::pilot` rule each seat's report uses, read for each plane
  from its own side (the report's friendly-fire test is relative to a side).
  Kills are the debrief's credit: the ledger's kill, else the last aircraft
  to hit the lost one, a human's loss included (no plane is the viewer, so
  none is left out). `aircraft_kills` are the kill table's first three rows
  (fighter, bomber, helicopter), `other_kills` the other seven. Friendly fire
  counts by side, so in a free-for-all two humans of one side count as friends
  here, which the scores do not. Air-to-ground missiles and bombs share the
  row's air-to-ground shots. A retired wreck is a row of status `Retired`
  with damage 100 percent; its aircraft comes from its wing, since its
  ownship is gone. Rows are ordered friendly side first, then wing, then
  member.
- **The message.** At the mission's end `send_results` (`host/results.rs`)
  sends one Results to every connection that is not closing, observers and
  players in the lobby included, after the final Scores and before Mission
  ended and each player's debrief. The rows carry the callsign of the last
  human who flew the plane, remembered by the plane when its player leaves
  (`Scoring::callsigns`, noted every tick and again at the end); the wire
  holds one callsign, so a plane flown by several players names the last. The
  final scores ride along in PvP only: co-op sends none.
- **The client** keeps the newest Results (`Client::results`) until the next
  mission or flight starts, logs a `results` line (the words of
  `tore_session::client::results::summary`), and `tore-bot` prints it
  (`NAME: results: ...`).
- **The pages** (`net/debrief.rs`, drawn by `debrief.rs`): the debrief screen
  turns **SCORES** and **RESULTS** in after the first page when the client
  holds Results, in that order, then the retail pages 2 to 5. SCORES is PvP
  only: the winner (or "No winner was named."), the heading of the tally, then
  rank, pilot, side, kills, lost, damage in aircraft and ratio for fifteen
  players a page, and each side's totals under the last when the fight is by
  sides. RESULTS lists every aircraft fifteen to a page, **a page never mixing
  the two sides** (so 20 against 10 is three pages, not two), headed
  "RESULTS : FRIENDLY SIDE" or "ENEMY SIDE": wing and member, callsign or AI,
  aircraft (its short name), status, aircraft shot down, hit percentage over
  every shot and damage. A callsign is cut to nine characters to fit its
  column. The clipboard's markup gained a `.columns X1 X2 ...` directive for
  these pages (cell n of a line starts at the n-th x, whatever the cells before
  it hold); the retail pages never use it. The pages are fitted to the retail
  fonts (fitted: the retail layout of this page is unknown). Connections that
  have no debrief of their own (observers, a player in the lobby) hold the
  results but no screen shows them yet.
- **Tests.** `debrief/results_tests.rs` in the world (30 aircraft in page
  order, every kind of row, a revived player's two planes, a retired wreck,
  the same ledger twice), `host/results_tests.rs` on the simulator (every
  connection gets one Results, a row for every plane, callsigns kept after a
  player leaves its flight, co-op without scores, a revival's wreck and new
  plane, a retired plane), `client/results.rs` (the words, and the real client
  keeping them until the next flight), the pages' cells and layout in
  `net/debrief.rs` and `debrief.rs` (30 aircraft and a dozen players in the
  bundled font, thirty players over two score pages, a lopsided mission, the
  `.columns` directive, the five retail pages unchanged), the ignored
  `debrief::net_pages::retail_art_draws_the_multiplayer_pages`, which draws
  every page with an imported profile's fonts and checks each cell against its
  column, and the net lane's `net-server-results`.

##### Friend or foe

- **The lock box's X.** Drawn today when the displayed target is on the
  *friendly* side (`main.rs`, `target_friendly`). It becomes "on the presented
  plane's side", so a player flying for the enemy side sees the X on its own
  side's aircraft. Single player always flies the friendly side, so it is
  unchanged.
- **IFF squawk (U).** Retail: "returns a Friendly message if you've targeted
  someone on your own side." The game answers from its copy of the mission:
  "IFF: Friendly" for an aircraft of the presented plane's side, "IFF: no
  reply" for any other (fitted: retail's other answer is unknown), "IFF: no
  target" with nothing designated. Today U says "IFF unavailable".
- **Show Target Info** (the Pref menu's row, Ctrl+T; listed as not implemented
  in the [menus lane](testing/lane-menus.md)). Retail: each target's identity
  below it in the forward view, with an aeroplane's current manoeuvre, orange,
  red when the object targets you, and in multiplayer each player's callsign
  beneath. Built from the frame's picture and readout: the identity of every
  visible aircraft and object, the manoeuvre for the displayed target (the
  target window's activity, the only one a client knows), red when the readout
  says it aims at the player, and the callsign of a human-flown aircraft from
  the roster. Off by default.

*Built (F2-C, 2026-10-05).* `target_info.rs` holds all three, as pure functions
of the flight's own copy of the mission: `Sides` answers the side of a plane
(the roster first, then the AI wings, then a runway's airport, friendly or
hostile; neutral and unknown airports are on no side), `iff` the squawk's
answer and `labels` the text under every visible aircraft and object. The
presented plane's side comes from the roster (a plane the roster does not list
is friendly), so single player is unchanged. The labels take the identity from
the frame's picture (an aircraft's exact identity, or an airport object's
name), the manoeuvre and the red from the readout's target brief, and the
callsign from the lobby state the client holds (the player whose slot is that
plane). They are drawn by the replay viewer's text routine, in the HUD's font
and size, under the aircraft's screen point. Agent decisions: a label reaches
10 nautical miles; at most 24 show, aircraft before objects and the nearest
first; the manoeuvre and the red are known for the displayed target only; the
orange is (255, 150, 40) and the red (255, 40, 40). Show Target Info is the Pref
row `Show target info?` and Ctrl+T (its imported accelerator), kept in
`FlightUi::target_info`, off at every flight's start and kept in a session's
menu.

##### Orders to human wingmen, and their replies

- **The order call.** A human lead's Alt-key order reaches human wingmen today
  only as a note that one was flown by a human (`ai_wings/orders.rs`). It
  becomes a radio call to each human member the order addressed: the lead's
  own order stems and a text line ("Lead: Break left"), delivered on that
  seat's channel with the usual hold and radio silence. The AI members act as
  before. Stage G's design (slice G3a, on the `multiplayer` branch) already
  turns the engage orders into assignment calls that every addressed wingman,
  human or AI, hears with its own bearing and range; F2-R voices every other
  order the same way and leaves those to G.
- **Replies and requests** are a new seat command, `SeatCommand::WingReply`,
  with four kinds from the guide: **Engaging** (Alt+Shift+E, `^ENGAGE`),
  **Winchester** (Alt+Shift+W, text only: no retail recording says it),
  **Bingo fuel** (Alt+Shift+B, `^BINGO`) and **Need help** (Alt+Shift+H, the
  retail recording whose phrase asks for help, `^CLRMY6` or `^OFFME`, chosen by
  its phrase text). The call goes from the seat's plane to its flight: every
  human of the wing hears it as a radio line ("Two: Winchester"). The AI does
  nothing with it (no AI work is asked for). A plane that leads its wing has no
  one to answer: the key says "You lead this flight." The keys work in single
  player too, where a lead has no human wingman, so they only say so.
- **Built (F2-C, 2026-10-05): the keys, ahead of their slices.** The four reply
  keys, K and U are catalog rows (`key:Alt-Shift-e` and the rest, so they remap
  like any key). Alt+Shift with a letter is read before the Alt letters, which
  stay the lead's orders; Alt+A and Alt+N stay free for stage G. Until the
  reply slice sends the call, the reply keys say "You lead this flight." for a
  plane that leads its wing (single player always does: John took this on
  2026-10-05) and "Winchester: not available yet" and so on for a wingman in a
  network flight; K says "Score board: network games only" in single player
  and, until F2-S drew the board, "Score board: not available yet" in a network
  flight. The slices that build them replace `flight_ui::reply_answer` and
  `score_board_answer`'s callers in `main.rs` (`Command::Reply` and
  `Command::ScoreBoard`); F2-S's K now opens the board in a network flight and
  says "network games only" in single player.
- **Keys** are in the [controls list](CONTROLS.md#multiplayer-phase-2) (built by F2-C; John took the recommended keys on 2026-10-05).
- **Built (F2-R, 2026-10-05).** The replies and the order call are built as
  designed; the build settled these, each an agent decision. F2-R replaced the
  "not available yet" lines above: `flight_ui::reply_answer` is gone, and a
  networked flight's keys send the call.

      Reply -->|"a flightmate"| Flight["Radio::reply: the flight's humans<br/>and the speaker as YOU, routine chatter"]
  ```

  - **Replies.** `World::wing_reply` (`world/replies.rs`) makes the call through
    `Radio::reply` (`radio_calls.rs`): to the speaker's flight, no delay, routine
    chatter, so a seat under radio silence does not hear it. Each human of the
    flight hears it under the speaker's place ("Red two: 'Winchester'"); the
    speaker hears its own as `YOU`. Engaging is `^ENGAGE`, Bingo fuel `^BINGO`,
    Winchester text only. **Need help is `^OFFME`**, "Get this guy off me", the
    retail recording that asks for help; `^CLRMY6`, "Clear my six", is the lead's
    Protect me order and not a wingman's to say. The line is the recording's
    imported text, or the key's words (`Reply::text`) where the pack gave none.
    The AI takes nothing from a reply, so a reply changes nothing the wing does.
  - **Refusals.** A plane that leads its flight (the radio's current leader, so a
    wingman that succeeded to the lead is refused, and one that lost it is not)
    gets "You lead this flight."; a plane that is down or whose pilot is out gets
    "No reply: your aircraft is down"; a seat may call once in two seconds
    ("Reply: wait a moment"), a flood guard that keeps a held key or a hostile
    client from filling the flight's queues. The seat's own cooldown key,
    `radio-reply`, is appended to the comms checkpoint's key table. A speaker whose
    own radio silence is on is told "Winchester: sent (radio silence is on)".
  - **Journal.** A reply is `Source::Reply` with the new cause
    `Cause::Replied(Reply)`; each refusal is a `Refused` entry with its reason
    (`Text("the speaker leads its flight")`, `AircraftLost` or `Cooldown`).
  - **The app.** In a networked flight the four keys queue
    `SeatCommand::WingReply` whatever the plane's place, and the world answers (the
    app no longer guesses that member 0 leads, which a succession can change);
    single player has no world reply and says "You lead this flight." itself, as
    before.
  - **The order call.** After an order is given, `World::call_human_wingmen` sends
    one call, in the lead's label ("Red one"), to every living human wingman the
    order addressed (`OrderReport::humans`) and to nobody else, each on its own
    channel. It is Important, so radio silence never drops it, and it has no delay.
    An attack order is worded by `calls::hearers` from each wingman's own place;
    "Attack bandits" is the same for all; the break, approach, formation, spacing,
    stacking, control, disengage and protect orders say their one recording with its
    text; bug out and land have no recording and are text only (their name). With
    only human wingmen addressed the lead still says the call (it used to be
    silent): the attack call from the first human's place, any other order as an AI
    wingman in its default state would say it (the spacing and stacking toggles
    start from the default).
  - **The sort.** Each human wingman dealt a bandit hears its own call at once; the
    lead's own voice sequence (3.5 seconds apart) and the battle net's repeat still
    carry the AI wingmen's calls only.
  - **`tore-bot`.** `--order SECONDS,NAME` (a lead's order) and `--reply
    SECONDS,KIND` (a wingman's key) give one seat command after the bot's first
    seating, and every bot prints the radio lines it hears (`Name: radio: Red one:
    'Break left'`) and the HUD lines it reads (`Name: line: You lead this flight.`).
  - **Tests.** `world/replies_tests.rs` (each reply reaches the flight's humans and
    no one else, the recordings' imported text and the fallback text, a lead's
    refusal, the journal, radio silence for the hearer and for the speaker, the
    two-second gap, a downed plane, no effect on the wing, the same twice; the order
    call to the human alone and with the AI, to one AI wingman only (the human hears
    nothing), text only for bug out, the attack call from the wingman's own place and
    the lead's voice for a human-only attack, the blanket order, the sort, a downed
    human, the same twice), `phase2_seams_tests` (a lead's reply in single player),
    `tore-bot`'s option parsing, two simulator tests in `bot.rs` (a lead bot's order
    and a wingman bot's reply reach each other through the host and the wire; a lead
    bot's reply is refused with no call), the app's key tests, and the `net`
    scenario `net-server-replies`.

##### The observer view

John (2026-09-28): observers use the replay viewer's camera and playback
controls on the live session, cannot chat with the players flying, and in PvP
the King can set a delay applied by the host, so an observer's machine never
holds live positions.

- **Who observes.** While a mission flies, a connection with no plane: in the
  lobby (a late joiner, a player who ended its flight), a player whose plane is
  lost and who has no revival, and a player whose plane the AI flies while it is
  away. The lobby's **Watch** button, and Watch on the revival prompt, start it.
- **The stream** (`host/observe.rs`). **Observe** (message 33) starts or stops
  it and names the camera's subject (an aircraft, or a point). The host answers
  **Observing** (message 34: a new flight, the roster, the destroyed ground
  objects, the delay) and then sends the connection ordinary snapshots with no
  own plane: no own state hash, no readout, no exact state. Relevance follows
  the camera: the subject, everything within 20 nm of the camera's point and
  any missile within 10 nm at the full rate, the rest 4 times a second. The
  client sends Observe again when the subject changes, or the point moves more
  than 2 nm, at most twice a second.
- **The delay.** With a delay D the host keeps, for D seconds, every
  snapshot's whole quantized picture and the mission-wide events with their
  ticks, and builds an observer's snapshots and events from tick now less D:
  nothing newer leaves the host. About 9 MB at a 60-second delay for 30
  aircraft (measured by the slice). Scores to an observer are delayed the same.
- **The screen** (`net/observe.rs`). The client's interpolated observer frames
  feed the replay recorder's conversion (the one a single-player flight
  records with) into an in-memory recording that grows as the mission flies,
  and the replay viewer plays it in a **live mode**: the playhead follows the
  newest frame; the player may pause, step back, scrub within what has arrived
  (the last 10 minutes are kept) and press End to return to live; it can never
  go past live. The viewer's cameras, views, labels and panels work as on any
  replay. Esc leaves the view for the lobby.

*Built (F2-O1, 2026-10-05): the stream.* The host's part is
`host/observe.rs`, the client's `client/observe.rs`, the bot's `tore-bot
--observe PLANE|none`. Each choice below is an agent decision unless it says
otherwise.

- **Asking.** Observe is taken from a player in the lobby, or leaving its plane
  (its watch starts once it is back in the lobby), while the mission flies. It
  is refused "The mission is not flying; watch once it flies.", "Leave your
  aircraft before you watch." (taking or flying a plane) and "There is no plane
  12." (an aircraft subject the roster does not hold). Stop with no watch does
  nothing. The watch starts at the next tick that finds the game in the lobby:
  a new flight of the connection, the Observing message, then snapshots.
- **The picture** is the whole mission, quantized once a tick it is needed and
  shared by every observer (`from_world::observer_picture`): while a human
  flies, the first such seat's picture, whose own plane is an aircraft like any
  other; with nobody flying, built from combat's targets as the combat snapshot
  draws them (a test holds the two equal for the AI's aircraft). Every aircraft
  and ejected pilot is sent, in real plane ids; no missile is "aimed at" an
  observer.
- **Relevance.** The camera's point is an aircraft subject's place in the
  picture shown (kept while the aircraft is gone) or the point asked for; the
  subject itself is "viewed". The netcode's bands then apply from that point:
  within 20 nm, and missiles within 10 nm, at the full rate, the rest twice a
  second. With no subject every entity is near, as the packet allows.
- **The camera.** The host applies at most two changes a second from one
  connection; a change sooner waits and the newest waiting is applied when the
  half second has passed. The client sends the camera only when it changed (a
  new subject, or a point more than 2 nm from the one sent), at most twice a
  second, and a change in between goes with a later update.
- **Events.** An observer gets the mission-wide events (the tracker's, and the
  AI's ejections) and never a seat's own. Without a delay they are queued each
  tick as a seated player's are, and a new observer is first sent the mission
  as it stands (the destroyed ground objects in Observing, the craters, fires
  and effects as events), as a seated player is.
- **The delay** applies to every observer of a PvP mission whose
  `observer-delay` is set (co-op has none). The ring records from the mission's
  first tick whenever the mission flies with a delay, watched or not, so an
  observer who starts sees the battle as it was a delay ago at once: one frame
  each snapshot interval, at the ticks whose number is a multiple of the ticks
  per snapshot, and every mission-wide event with the tick it became known.
  **Every delayed observer's snapshot ticks are the ring's** (a correction to
  the wire's lobby-id phase, which holds without a delay): the host sends the
  frame of its tick less the delay, and with it the events that became known by
  then and the messages held for that tick. Events falling out of the ring are
  folded into the mission as it stood (the destroyed ground objects and the
  craters and fires), which is what a new delayed observer is told stands;
  short-lived effects are not carried. While the ring is younger than the delay
  the first snapshot waits until the delay has passed (Observing's tick says
  which it is).
- **News at a tick** the other slices send observers goes through
  `Host::send_as_of(connection, tick, message)`, which holds it for a delayed
  observer until its stream shows that tick (F2-S's scores, F2-V's new planes).
  The roster and the lobby state are not held: they carry no positions.
- **The end.** The stream ends with Observing's end at the observer's Stop
  (messages still held then go out), before the Seated message of a plane it
  takes, and at the mission's end, before the results and Mission ended. A
  delayed observer does not see the mission's last delay.
- **The client.** `Client::watch(subject)` asks (and moves the camera),
  `Client::stop_watching` stops, `Client::watching` says where it stands and
  `Client::observer_frame` gives the frame: every aircraft as a target in its
  real plane id, the ground objects, projectiles, debris, pilots, effects and
  marks, an empty player pose (no aircraft, plane `u32::MAX`), and the
  mission-wide events once the picture reaches them. The client stays in the
  lobby phase while it watches, and its automatic ready takes no plane. An
  observer's frames are not written to a capture.
- **Measured** (`host/observe_tests.rs`): with 30 aircraft the ring holds about
  4.6 KB a frame, 8.4 MB for a 60-second delay (1,800 frames); an observer of a
  15 against 15 fight, its camera on a plane in it, is sent about 12 KB a
  second, and the `net-server-observe` scenario's observer of twelve aircraft
  about 5 KB a second.
- **Room.** An observer is a connection like any other, so it counts against
  the handshake's capacity (the lesser of the player limit and the open
  planes): a game full of players takes no observer.

*Built (F2-O2, 2026-10-05): the screen.* The game's part is
`tore-app` `net/observe.rs`, the viewer's live mode is in `replay/` and the
routing is `net/play.rs`, `replay/host.rs` and `main.rs`. Each choice below is
an agent decision unless it says otherwise.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  client["Client::observer_frame<br/>(a drawn picture, real plane ids)"] --> feeder["Feeder<br/>one replay frame per host tick"]
  feeder --> store["Store thread<br/>writes the growing file,<br/>reads it again"]
  store --> viewer["Viewer::grow<br/>(the playhead follows the newest frame)"]
  viewer --> subject["camera subject<br/>(Client::watch, twice a second at most)"]
  subject --> client
```

- **The live recording** (`Feeder`, `Store`). Each observer frame becomes one
  replay frame for every host tick the picture has passed (a tick between two
  drawn pictures is the two blended as flight blends its ticks; a silence of
  more than two seconds is left as a gap). The frames hold every aircraft in
  its real plane id, the weapons in flight (registered as they first appear,
  by the mission's station weapon of that name, else a plain missile), debris,
  ejected pilots, the effects, craters and fires that started, the ground
  objects that fell, and two kinds of event for the timeline's markers: a
  launch, and the loss of an aircraft seen flying. The header has no player
  (`draw.player` is `u32::MAX`, `convert::NO_PLAYER`), the mission's models,
  and `draw.slots` high enough for planes a revival adds later. The writer
  writes chunks of a fifth of a second to `observer/` in the data folder (not
  the system's temporary folder, which can be memory), on a thread of its
  own, which reads the file again a quarter of a second after new frames
  (three times as long as the last read took, when that is longer) and hands
  the viewer the new read. The file keeps the whole mission and goes when the
  watch ends; a crash's leftover goes the next day. Measured (debug build):
  ten minutes of 30 aircraft is 3,000 chunks and 16 MB, and a read takes
  0.18 s. Rotating the file to keep only ten minutes is not built.
- **The viewer's live mode** (`Viewer::open_live`, `Viewer::grow`). The same
  viewer, its cameras, views, labels, panels, trails and weather. It opens at
  the first read with the playhead a second behind the newest frame
  (`Clock::new_live`); `grow` takes each newer read: the playback, the
  sound and the track pass read only what was added (`Playback::extend`,
  `Scanner::start_live`, `ReplaySound::extend`), the registry and the markers
  follow, and the clock's range is the newest frame and ten minutes back (the
  rest stays in the file, out of reach). The playhead plays at 1x and is
  trimmed 10 percent to keep a second behind the newest frame while frames
  arrive in bursts; it waits at the newest frame when none come and never
  passes it. The transport bar reads **LIVE** while it follows. Pausing,
  scrubbing, reversing and changing speed leave live; **End** returns to it
  (forwards at 1x, a second behind), as does closing the Escape menu on a
  playhead that was live when it opened. A following playhead that frames
  late and all at once left more than three seconds behind is brought back.
- **No player.** Every aircraft is another: the first aircraft is selected,
  no pose is drawn as the player's ownship, and the weather steps from a view
  at the origin (an observer has no player's path to follow; the sky is the
  launch sky plus time). The camera's subject goes to the host
  (`Viewer::camera_subject`): the selected aircraft, or the free drone's
  point, so what is near the camera is sent at the full rate.
- **Seat-aware viewer** (John, 2026-10-05). The viewer follows the plane the
  recording is for (`draw.player`, plane 0 when absent) wherever it looked
  for plane 0: the first selection, the anchor and the object lists, the
  panels' roster, the weather's player view and the tracks, the target the
  views follow, the sound's listener, down tone and releases, the Replays
  screen's details and the scripted director's anchor. A single-player
  recording has no `draw.player`, so none of it changes. The capture
  conversion no longer swaps ids ([converting a capture](#converting-a-capture-into-a-replay)).
- **Watch and Esc.** Pressing the lobby's Watch asks the host as before. The
  host's Observing message starts a watch; when the first frames have been
  recorded the game opens the viewer over the lobby (`Screen::Replay`), and
  the session keeps its turn from the viewer's redraw. The Escape menu is the
  replay viewer's, with its first row reading **Stop Watching**: it tells the
  host, puts the recording away and shows the lobby. A mission that ends, a
  watch the host ends, a seat taken and a session that ends do the same, and
  the lobby says why in Messages. Agent decision: the design said "Esc leaves
  the view for the lobby"; Esc opens the viewer's menu, which pauses and also
  holds Graphics, Sound and Control, and Enter on its first row leaves.
- **What is not there yet.** Smoke, contrails and gun rounds (as in converted
  captures: slice E2's `NetEffects` regenerates them there over a conversion's frames. It is not wired into the live recording, which is not a small step: it borrows the mission's world and reads gun bursts from the conversion's events, while the observer's frames come one at a time on the render thread and their events are not turned into replay events yet);
  radio lines, HUD messages and the AI's thinking (the observer stream does not
  carry them); each aircraft's fuel, G and controls. An **away** player's own
  plane is shown here too, over its flight ([built in F2-O3](#the-observer-screen-for-an-away-players-own-plane-f2-o3)).
  The Replays list does not list the observer's file (it is not a replay;
  nothing keeps it).
- **Tests.** `net::observe` (the frames for every tick a picture passes and
  their blends, the registry once, effects and craters and losses once, a real
  observer's frames from a host and a bot on the simulator becoming a recording
  with every tick and each plane where the observer drew it, the store and the
  playback, a recording that cannot start saying so once, and the ignored
  ten-minute measurement), `replay::clock` (live
  follows, waits, never passes, leaves and returns), `replay::playback`
  and `replay::tracks` (a growing recording plays and scans as the finished one),
  `replay::viewer` (a recording for another seat, an observer's with no
  player, the live view's growth, window, End and menu, the camera's subject),
  the conversion's plane-1 tests (`client::convert_tests`, `replay::net_convert`)
  and the net lane's `net-window-observe`.

##### The AI flies an idle player's aircraft

The open question since 2026-09-28 (the guide's agent proposal: after 10
seconds without input the AI flies the aircraft until the player touches the
controls). Designed as the King's setting `idle-ai` (question 4). *Changed by
John, 2026-10-06 (slice F2-O4):* the default is 5 minutes (never, 1, 2, 5 or
10 minutes), and no flight input takes the aircraft back: the player comes
back on purpose from the observer screen's menu
([below](#the-away-players-menu-f2-o4)). The bullets below say which words
F2-O4 changed.

- **Away** is not a centred stick, which a player cruising hands-off also
  sends. A game is away while its controls are neutral because of a menu (the
  Esc or pause menu, a settings screen), the window lacking focus, or the loss
  of the controller it was flying with; the client sends **Away** (message 35)
  once that has lasted the setting's seconds. A game whose loop is stalled (the
  [stall rule](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k)) is away by the host's own
  count after the same time.
- **The host** gives the plane back to the AI (GiveBack, the handoff's rules)
  and **reserves** it for that player: nobody else takes it, and its slot reads
  "AI (Viper away)". The player's connection observes its own plane meanwhile
  (the observer stream, its subject the plane), and the screen says "The AI is
  flying your aircraft. Press Esc, then Take Back Flight, to fly it again."
  (*F2-O4; F2-A said "Move the stick or press any flight key to take it
  back."*)
- **Back** (message 36), from the menu's **Take Back Flight** (*F2-O4; F2-A
  sent it at the first flight input with no menu up and the window focused*):
  the host takes the plane back for the player at the next tick (a Take, a new
  flight), with its stores and damage as the AI left them. A plane lost while
  the AI flew it is lost to the player as any other (revival rules).

*Built (F2-A, 2026-10-05).* John took the design on 2026-10-05 (the
[decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions)). The host's part is `host/away.rs`, the
client's `client/away.rs`, the game's `net/away.rs` (called from
`net/play.rs`, with one line in `main.rs` for a lost controller), the bot's
`tore-bot --away SECONDS,FOR`. No wire change: Away, Back and the lobby
state's away mark are F2-0's. Each choice below is an agent decision unless
the design above says it.

- **The game's count.** The game is away while its controls are neutral
  because a menu or a screen is over the flight, the window lacks focus, or
  the controller it flew with went (until any flight input). It reads the
  setting from the lobby state and sends Away once, after that many seconds
  (5 minutes by default since F2-O4);
  never while its plane is lost (the revival rules have it). A **flight
  input** is a stick or rudder axis past 0.1, a throttle key, the throttle
  lever moved 0.05 from where it was while flying, the trigger, or any
  pilot or seat command (`net::away::touched`); views and the mouse look are
  not.
- **The host's count.** A seated player whose game has sent no input for the
  setting's seconds is away, counted from the newest input tick the host
  holds, or from the tick it first saw the flight (a new flight starts
  afresh). The EF-K stall rule flies the plane neutral from half a second,
  then the AI flies it; the keepalive keeps the connection as before. The log
  says which: "Viper is away: the AI flies plane 0", "Viper is away (its
  game sends nothing): the AI flies plane 0".
- **The handoff.** At the next tick (`away_commands`, before the step) the
  seat's plane goes back by GiveBack and the player is in the lobby, its
  seat freed, its slot, loadout and ready mark kept. Its connection watches
  the plane at once (`start_watch` with the plane as the subject, the
  observer flight starting at the same tick), with the PvP observer delay
  as every observer has it, so a player away sees no more than an observer
  does. The lobby state marks it away and observing.
- **The reservation.** The plane is kept while the player is away: another
  player's Join is refused "Plane 0 is kept for Viper, who is away.", an
  `ai-slot` revival skips it (`Host::reserved`), and the away player's own
  Join is refused "Your aircraft waits for you: move the stick or press any
  flight key to take it back.": Back is the way back. A mission whose only
  players are away is not empty, so the empty timeout does not end it.
- **Back** takes the plane at the next tick by a Take for a free seat (the
  seat may differ from the one before). The King's rules on taking a plane
  (join in progress, slot locks, lock sides) do not apply: the plane is the
  player's own. The observer flight ends before the Seated message, as for
  any observer who takes a plane. Back from a player not away is refused
  "The AI is not flying your aircraft.", Away with the setting at never "The
  AI flies no idle aircraft in this game.", Away from a player not flying
  "You are not flying.", and Away with a plane already lost "Your aircraft
  is lost: the AI cannot fly it."
- **The reservation ends** when the player takes the plane back, stops
  watching (it leaves the plane to the AI: "Viper left plane 0 to the AI";
  the game's End Mission does this in a lobby-screen game), leaves the game
  on purpose, or the mission ends; and when the AI loses the plane. Then the
  player is told "The AI lost your aircraft while you were away.", watches on
  as any player without a plane, and the revival rules have it: under
  `respawn none` it takes no other plane this mission ("No revival in this
  game."), and under `ai-slot` and `revive` it flies again by the King's
  rules, with its lives and the delay counted from the loss. *As built, K5
  (2026-10-05):* this replaces F2-A's first build, which counted neither: the
  world's revival needed a seat holding the lost plane and the AI had held
  this one, so slice K5 added the world's `ReviveLost`
  ([rejoin](#rejoin-tokens-and-reservations)). A player whose connection
  drops while away keeps the reservation as a dropped player's, one table
  for both. A loss while away is not the player's in the scores either
  (F2-S credits the human flying at the tick).
- **The client** (`Client::ai_flies`, `away_asked`) learns of the handoff from
  the Observing message that reaches it while it flies (the host's count
  gives no other word): its flight ends and it is in the lobby phase,
  watching. Back's Seated, the observer flight's end, the mission's end or
  a lobby state without the away mark clear it. `away()` and `back()` send
  once each.
- **The game.** While the AI flies the plane the game shows it on the
  observer screen over the flight (slice F2-O3, [below](#the-observer-screen-for-an-away-players-own-plane-f2-o3)),
  or, when that cannot open, takes the aircraft back at once (*F2-O4; F2-O3
  kept the flight's last picture, with no menu to come back from*), and says
  "The AI is flying your aircraft. Press Esc, then Take Back Flight, to fly it
  again." every five seconds; Back's Seated starts the flight again as a
  revival's does. *As built in F2-A, before F2-O3:* the flight screen always
  kept its last picture. A refusal of Away or Back is said on the HUD. If the
  host stops keeping the plane and no Seated follows within two seconds, the
  flight ends (*F2-O4:* unless the observer screen is up, which stays for the
  menu's Spawn in Aircraft).
- **The slot's words.** The lobby screen's "AI (Viper away)" is the screen's
  to draw from the away mark (slice F2-L's files); not drawn yet.
- **Tests.** `host/away_tests.rs` (on the simulator: the handoff and the
  reservation, the stores and damage carried back, the host's count, never
  and a longer setting, a plane the AI loses, stopping and leaving, the empty
  timeout), `client/away_tests.rs` (the real client away and back, an 11
  second stall with keepalives, a loss, an away game leaving), the game's
  `net::away` unit tests (the flight inputs, the count, a lost controller,
  the end), `tore-bot`'s option and the net lane's `net-server-away`. The
  EF-K and J3 tests that stall 15 seconds set the setting to never: the
  keepalives are what they test. *F2-O4:* the lists start at a minute, so the
  tests that wait out the setting in simulated time set 10 seconds through
  `Store::set_for_test`.

##### The observer screen for an away player's own plane (F2-O3)

*Built (F2-O3, 2026-10-06).* John asked for it on 2026-10-06: while the AI
flies an away player's aircraft the player watches it on the observer screen
and takes it back at the first flight input. No wire change. *Changed the
same day, F2-O4:* no flight input takes it back; the Escape menu does
([below](#the-away-players-menu-f2-o4)). The bullets that describe the
hand-back are kept as built and marked. Each choice below
is an agent decision unless it says otherwise.

  stop -->|no| back
```

- **Opening.** The host's Observing message reaches a flying game that the
  client has marked as away (`Client::ai_flies`, set before the event), and
  the game starts its watch ([`net/observe.rs`](../crates/tore-app/src/net/observe.rs)) as a lobby
  watcher's does. Once the first frames are recorded the viewer opens over
  the flight with the player's own plane selected, so the camera's subject
  to the host is that plane. The flight world and its scenery stay as they
  are under it; the flight's menu, map and held keys are put away as it
  opens, so nothing of them is open when the flight returns. It waits while
  the controls, graphics or sound screen is open over the flight. If the
  recording cannot start or the viewer cannot open, the game says so, keeps
  the watch the host started and keeps the old picture and banner (stopping
  the watch would leave the plane to the AI).
- **What counts as a flight input there (removed in F2-O4: nothing counts, and
  every key and the mouse are the viewer's).** The idle rule's own list
  (`net::away::touched`: a stick or rudder axis past 0.1, a throttle key, the
  lever moved 0.05, the trigger, a pilot command), read as before from the
  controls' profile, with the input paused only while a menu of the viewer's
  is open (`App::input_paused`): the controllers (stick, rudder, lever, the
  trigger and every button, whose pilot commands the screen queues as the
  flight does), the flight's primary keys (the arrows, unless Shift makes
  them look, Z, X, End, Page Down, Space and 1 to 8), and any key the
  profile binds on the keyboard. Those keys are the flight's on this screen:
  the viewer does not see them, so the arrows no longer scrub (the Escape
  menu and the mouse's bar still do). The viewer keeps every other key
  and the mouse: the player may still change aircraft (Tab), views, panels
  and the drone. *Not read here:* the flight's systems and weapons keys
  (gear, flaps, chaff and the rest: their letters are the viewer's panels
  and the drone's), the instrument keys and clicks (seat commands) and the
  mouse; the stick, throttle, trigger and a profile's own keys are what
  take the plane back. A press with the viewer's menu open, with Alt or the
  system key held, or while the window lacks focus is not an input, as on the
  flight screen.
- **Back (F2-O4: from the menu's Take Back Flight, not an input).** As F2-A
  built it: the first input sends Back (the log says "a
  flight input; taking the aircraft back from the AI" once for a handoff),
  the host ends the observer flight before it sends Seated, the viewer
  closes at the end of the observer flight and the flight screen shows
  again, and Seated starts the new flight as a revival's does. A mission
  that ends, the AI losing the plane and the session ending close the
  observer screen with the flight, as they ended the flight before.
- **Stop Watching (F2-O4: the row is gone from this menu; Take Back Flight,
  Spawn in Aircraft and Leave Game take its place).** The Escape menu's first
  row kept its words. For an away player it meant: leave the aircraft to the AI and go to the lobby
  (the host's rule for stopping a watch), when the game has a lobby screen
  and does not host; otherwise, taking the aircraft back (a game with no
  lobby screen has nowhere to go, and a hosted game ends when its player
  leaves).
- **The banner** is said on the viewer's top line (the flight's HUD is not
  drawn) every five seconds, as on the flight screen, in fewer words (the
  line is short): "The AI is flying your aircraft. Press a flight key to take
  it back."
- **Tests.** `net::away` (the flight's primary keys, the viewer's own keys
  left alone, a menu of the viewer's and Alt or the system key, a profile's
  bound key and its release, the controller's stick and trigger read with no
  key, a key taken by the next frame that is not held, Back said once, Stop
  Watching's two ways), `net::observe` (who shows a watch and when the viewer
  opens), and the net lane's windowed `net-window-away-watch` (the game flies,
  opens its flight menu, goes away after 10 seconds, shows the AI flying its
  own plane on the observer screen, takes it back by the Up arrow, then again
  and takes it back by Stop Watching; the logs of the game and the server).

##### The away player's menu (F2-O4)

*Built (F2-O4, 2026-10-06).* John asked for it on 2026-10-06, in three parts:
the idle time is longer (10 seconds was too short for someone on autopilot
who steps away), no flight input takes the aircraft back (it is a flight sim
and nobody should fly AFK), and the player comes back on purpose from the
observer screen's Escape menu. No wire change and no new protocol version:
the setting's value is the same 32-bit number of seconds, and the checkpoint
and journal coders carry it as they carried 10: the session part codes every
registry value and restores them through the registry's own checks, so the new
values (60 to 600) restore, and a value off the lists would not (only a test
sets one, with `Store::set_for_test`, and none of them takes a checkpoint). Each choice below is an agent decision unless it says John.

```

- **The idle time (John).** `idle-ai` is never, 1, 2, 5 or 10 minutes, 5 by
  default in co-op and PvP (the list is an agent decision; John suggested
  never, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes). The lobby's Settings row already prints
  seconds that are whole minutes in minutes ("5 minutes"), and a dedicated
  server's file writes it in minutes (`idle-ai 5`, `idle-ai never`), as
  `time-limit` and `revive-delay` are. The wire sample for the lobby state
  keeps its 10 seconds, so the golden file does not change.
- **No flight input takes it back (John).** The idle rule counts only to send
  Away now. The flight's keys, the controllers and the mouse are not read on
  the observer screen: every key is the viewer's again (the arrows scrub, Space
  pauses). `net::away`'s key table and the controller reading are gone.
- **The menu.** The first tab's first rows replace Stop Watching, in the
  retail look of the existing pause menu: **Take Back Flight** while the
  player's own reserved aircraft is alive; **Spawn in Aircraft** when no
  aircraft is reserved for the player (the AI lost it while the player was
  away, or the King released it); and **Leave Game**. Graphics, Sound, Control
  and Exit to Desktop stay. A row that does not apply is not shown (agent
  decision), except Spawn in Aircraft, which is dimmed with its reason beside
  it when the revival rules allow nothing now ("No revival in this game", "No
  lives left", "You can fly again in 0:45", "Waiting for room for another
  aircraft"); choosing it says the reason. The game rebuilds the rows each
  frame from what it knows, so the row changes as the state does.
- **Take Back Flight** sends Back (message 36), as the first input did; the
  menu closes, the host takes the aircraft at the next tick with its stores
  and damage as the AI left them, and the flight starts again as before.
- **Spawn in Aircraft** is the revival rules' own, not new ones. After a loss
  while away the host noted the loss for the player (slice K5), so the game
  sends Revive (message 28): the respawn rule, lives and delay of
  [death and revival](#death-revival-and-lives) apply, and its refusals read
  in the rules' words. After the King's Release no loss is noted, so the game
  takes any free aircraft with TakePlane, by the usual take rules (join in
  progress, slot locks, lock sides), as a returning player who finds its
  aircraft gone does. The observer screen now stays up when the host stops
  keeping the aircraft (it used to end the flight after two seconds), so
  the row is there to choose; it closes at the Seated message.
- **Leave Game** leaves the session as End Mission's leave does (agent
  decision, checked in `host/rejoin.rs`): the game says goodbye, and the host
  frees an away player's reservation when its goodbye is a leave on purpose
  (`LeaveReason::Left`), so the aircraft stays with the AI, free for others.
  This is John's 2026-10-05 rule (End Mission releases; only a drop keeps the
  aircraft) applied to leaving on purpose. **A game that only joined** (a
  dedicated server's, a friend's) never hosts: it just leaves, with no
  handover and no confirmation (John, 2026-10-06). **A hosting game** hands
  the game over to a ready standby: the hosting thread is stopped first, which
  hands over (`Host::hand_over`) before the game's own connection says
  goodbye, since the house leaving ends a game that has not handed over. With
  no ready standby the row asks twice: its first choice reads "Choose again to
  end it" beside the row, and the second leaves, which ends the game for
  everyone. The game learns whether a standby is ready from the hosting
  thread's report ([`Report::Standby`](../crates/tore-app/src/net/hosting.rs)).
- **The live menu's words.** The menu of a live view (an away player's own
  aircraft, or an observer's) no longer says "REPLAY PAUSED" or "Resume
  replay": its title is "MENU - THE MISSION GOES ON" and its first button
  "Back to watching" (`pause::LIVE_LOOK`). A recording's menu keeps its words.
- **When the observer screen cannot open** (the recording cannot start, the
  viewer cannot open) there is no menu to come back from, so the game takes the
  aircraft back at once and says so, rather than keeping a picture nobody can
  leave.
- **Tests.** `replay::pause` (the menu's rows in each state as text
  snapshots: own aircraft alive, lost with a rule that allows a new one, lost
  with the rules allowing nothing, a host with and without a standby; each
  row's choice; the confirm), `net::away` (the idle rule with no hand-back, the
  observer screen kept after a loss, the rows from the game's state and the
  reasons), `net::standby` (only a hosting game with no ready standby ends the
  game by leaving; one with a standby hands over; the joined games never end
  it), `host::rejoin_tests` (Spawn after a loss, under no revival, after a
  release), `settings` and `tore-server`'s `config` (the list, the default,
  the words and the file's minutes), and the net lane's `net-window-away-watch`
  (a `tore-server` with `idle-ai 1`: the Up arrow takes nothing back, Take Back
  Flight does, Leave Game ends the session; two waits of about a minute).

##### The lobby's display

The lobby screen (EF8) gains the following; *built by F2-L*, see
[the lobby panels as built](#the-lobby-panels-as-built-f2-l) for what the
build settled:

- **Buttons.** The King: Mission..., Settings..., Players..., Loadout, Ready,
  Fly, Leave, seven at 75 wide on a 79 pitch across the 549-wide row. Everyone
  else: Settings..., Loadout, Ready, Leave. While the mission flies Loadout
  reads **Watch**.
- **Settings...** opens a panel over the lobby with the registry's rows as the
  creator's text buttons (left click forward, right click back), on four pages
  behind the rocker: Game (mode, players, join in progress, visibility, password,
  friendly fire, lock sides, loadouts, idle aircraft, observer delay), Revival
  (respawn, lives, delay, distance, weapons), Scoring (fight, tally, time limit,
  kill limit, kill owner) and Realism (the mission's cheats). Every player sees
  it; for anyone but the King every row is greyed, as retail greys a client's
  settings. A row that does not apply (scoring in co-op) is greyed for the King
  too.
- **Players...** (the King): for the player selected in Players, Kick (EF8's
  reason panel) and Give the crown.
- **Slot locks.** The King's right click on a slot cycles open and closed;
  with a player selected in Players it reserves the slot for that player. A
  closed slot reads "Closed (AI)", a reserved one "Reserved: Hawk".
- **The head line** summarises the settings in words under the start rule:
  "Co-op, friendly fire on, no revival" or "PvP by sides, 5 kills or 10
  minutes, revival with unlimited lives".

##### The lobby panels as built (F2-L)

*Built (F2-L, 2026-10-05).* The screen shows and asks; the host decides
(`lobby_screen/settings_panel.rs`, `players_panel.rs`, `facts.rs`, `mod.rs` and
the game's side in `app.rs`). Every choice is an agent decision unless it says
otherwise.

- **The seven buttons.** The King: Mission..., Settings..., Players...,
  Loadout, Ready, Fly, Leave, 75 wide on a 79 pitch from x 45; everyone else:
  Settings..., Loadout, Ready, Leave in the last four places (Leave is always
  in the last). **Kick** moved from its own button into the Players panel, as
  the design says. Settings... is for everyone while the lobby's state is
  here; Players... is the King's, enabled when a player other than the King's
  own row is selected in Players ("Select another player in Players first."
  otherwise). Facts: `facts::buttons`, `LoadoutAs`.
- **Settings.** One panel over the lobby, four pages behind four page buttons
  (Game, Revival, Scoring, Realism; agent decision: buttons, not a rocker,
  because each page has its own rows). The rows are the registry's
  ([the settings](#the-kings-settings)), each a label and a grey value box:
  a left click turns it to the next allowed value, a right click to the one
  before, wrapping round; Right, Left and Enter do the same from the keyboard,
  Up and Down choose a row, Tab and Shift+Tab turn the page, Esc closes. A row
  sends exactly one `SettingsChange` and shows the value the host's next lobby
  state carries, never a guess; the host's refusal ("2 players are connected:
  the limit cannot be lower.") reads at the foot of the panel. Rows turn
  through every allowed value in order, so the player limit takes up to 29
  clicks to cross its range (no step of five yet). A value off the list (a
  server's file gives a time limit of any whole minute) turns to the nearest
  listed value in the direction asked. The Game page is the game's name and
  the password as two text lines (the King's: type, press Enter; an empty
  password line with a password set takes it away), then game type, players,
  join in progress, who can find it, friendly fire, lock sides, loadouts, how
  long before the AI flies an idle aircraft, and observer delay.
- **Greying** (`settings_panel::row_state`, tested for every row): for anyone
  but the King every row is greyed ("Only the King may change the
  settings."); a lobby-only row while the mission flies ("Change it in the
  lobby, between missions."); PvP-only rows in co-op ("This applies only in a
  PvP game."; the time limit is not one); the Realism rows before the mission
  has arrived. A click on a greyed row says why at the foot of the panel.
- **Realism** is the lobby mission's own cheats: Damage (Normal, Invulnerable,
  Realistic), Enemy AI (Unchanged and the four levels) and the thirteen
  switches of the in-flight Cheat menu that work. A click sends the whole
  mission again with the changed cheats as a mission change (`Request::Cheats`,
  `client.change_mission`); every player's copy rebuilds, and ready marks clear
  as a mission change does. Guns only is the mission's own air combat setting
  and stays with Mission...; it is not a Realism row.
- **Players.** For the selected player: **Give crown** (`pass_crown`, then the
  panel closes) and **Kick...**, which opens EF8's reason panel. The house is
  not offered Kick, with the reason in the panel; the panel closes by itself
  when its player leaves or the crown is no longer ours.
- **Slot locks.** The King's right click on a slot row (a main.rs hunk of
  seven lines routes the right button to `App::lobby_right_button`; the left
  button's path is unchanged): with no player selected it cycles open and
  closed, a reserved slot opens; with a player selected in Players it keeps
  the slot for that player, or opens it when it is kept for that player
  already. A closed slot reads "Closed (AI)", a reserved one "Reserved:
  Hawk", both dimmed unless the slot is kept for the reader; a click on
  one says "Plane 3 is closed: the AI flies it." or "Plane 3 is kept for
  Hawk." The holder column grew to fit (the aircraft column shrank; see the
  layout in [menu formats](formats/menu.md)).
- **Watch.** While the mission flies the Loadout button reads **Watch** for a
  player with no plane (**Stop Watch** while watching, **Loadout** in the
  lobby). Pressing it asks the host for the observer stream with no camera
  subject (`client.watch`) and says so in Messages; Ready (Join) stops the
  watch first. The stream shows in the replay viewer's live mode once the
  first frames are recorded ([the observer screen](#the-observer-view), slice
  F2-O2); Stop Watching in its Escape menu returns here.
- **The head.** A fourth line, "Rules: Co-op, friendly fire on, no revival" or
  "Rules: PvP by sides, 5 kills or 10 minutes, revival with unlimited lives,
  sides locked", sums the settings up (`facts::settings_summary`: game type and
  fight, friendly fire in co-op and when off, the kill and time limits, the
  revival rule and lives, locked sides, any loadout). The four head lines moved
  up to y 102, 115, 128 and 141 to make room.
- **Messages** now say what the host's lobby state changed: the settings
  ("Settings: mode pvp, kill-limit 3."), the game's new name, and a slot's
  lock ("Plane 3's slot is closed: the AI flies it.").
- **Load Ordnance** follows the King's loadout rule (`ordnance.rs`):
  under `loadouts any` the lobby page's Cheat row works as single player's
  does; under `own` it answers "Cheat loading is not allowed in a
  multiplayer game." as before. Accept checks the loadout with
  `LoadoutSpec::check_in` against the lobby mission (its Guns only and its
  loadout rule), and a page that is open or kept when the King turns the rule
  to `own` drops its Cheat loading (stations unloaded, Cheat off, a line on the
  page). Single player's page is not a lobby page and is unchanged.
- **Tests.** `lobby_screen/phase2_tests.rs` (buttons and their greying, every
  registry row on a page, each row's greying, the turning of every setting
  through its values, the cheats' edits, the name and password lines, the
  panel on the screen with the mouse and the keyboard, the Players panel, slot
  locks, Watch, the head's words and Messages' lines, every page drawing for
  the King and a joiner), `ordnance.rs` (the rule), twelve more headless
  snapshot states (`lobby-settings` and the rest; the menus lane's
  `menus-snap-lobby-*`) and the net lane's `net-window-lobby`, which drives the
  window: the King's game hosts from Direct Connection's New, a `tore-bot`
  joins once the Game type is PvP (the default mission has one friendly
  plane, so the hosting player fills it), the script turns Game type, Friendly
  fire, the Scoring page's kill limit and the Realism page's Damage, closes and
  opens the bot's slot with the right click, selects the bot and gives it the
  crown with Players...; the bot wears the crown, and when it leaves the crown
  comes back. Single player is unchanged (the quick guard).

##### Single player in phase 2

Nothing above changes single player by default. Its spec never carries the new
fields, the scoring facts are off, the mission commands and messages are never
sent, the debrief adds pages only with a Results message, and the X now
follows the presented plane's side, which in single player is always the
friendly one.
Three retail features reach single player (John agreed on 2026-10-05,
question 2, and F2-C built them): U's IFF answer, Show Target Info, and the
reply keys' "You lead this flight." line. The slices that touch the mission core (F2-1, F2-S, F2-V, F2-R) run the
single-player baseline and must compare SAME; the others run the quick guard.

##### State for exact checkpoints

Stage H must carry what phase 2 adds to the mission core: the scoring switch
(`World::set_scoring`) with the targets whose end it has recorded
(`score::Recorder::recorded`; built by F2-S, coded by H10 in `score_checkpoint.rs` with the facts waiting), every `Pilot::Lost` plane and its cockpit, the
spawned planes (their roster entries, AI actors, combat rows) and which planes
are retired: since F2-V the world's `revival` field (`revive::Book`: each
abandoned plane with the tick it was abandoned and the tick its wreck came to
rest, the retired planes' roster entries and the planes revivals added,
coded in its own section, 11, since the rebase on stage H; the mission
identity counts only the planes the mission was built with), and combat's
next target id, which adding a spawned plane's row advances. The facts
themselves are drained every tick and are not state. What the host session
keeps (the settings, the crown and the house, slot locks, lives and delays,
the seats held for players whose plane is lost, revivals asked for, each
side's start, the spawned planes a joiner is sent, tallies, observers' delay
rings, away reservations)
is the session's, which stage K moves with the host.

##### Phase 2 slices

Every slice follows the lead's rules for Milestone 2's remaining stages
(John, 2026-10-05): targeted tests, each added to the full suite, a battery
scenario for anything done through a binary (the `net` lane,
`docs/testing/lane-net.md`, being built beside this design), a rule in
`tools/battery_selection.py` for every new file, and an entry in the run's test
ledger. Each slice's tests go in **files of their own** (`host/king_tests.rs`,
`host/score_tests.rs` and so on), never in the shared `host/tests.rs`, so
parallel slices do not collide. F2-0 takes **the next protocol version** for
every message below; no later slice changes the wire without the lead.

| Slice | Model | After | Owns | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F2-0 Wire and seams | Opus | | `tore-session`: `wire/messages.rs`, `wire/inputs.rs`, `wire/mod.rs` (the version), the wire tests and `wire-golden.txt`, new `settings.rs`, new empty `host/{king,revive,score,observe,away,results}.rs` and the calls to them in `host/mod.rs`, `client/mod.rs` (events and senders); `tore-world`: `seats.rs` (`WingReply`, `Pilot::Lost`), `world/commands.rs` (the new commands' variants), new `world/{revive,replies}.rs` and `score.rs` holding only the shared types | Every message and field of the [phase 2 wire](formats/net-protocol.md#phase-2-the-kings-settings-revival-scores-and-observers) with its coding; the settings registry with ranges, defaults, names and checks, and the host's settings store (defaults, no King's changes yet); the types the slices share (`Reply`, `Spawn`, `RevivalWeapons`, score facts); the hooks each slice fills (the take check, the tick's revive, score and away calls, message dispatch), each doing nothing yet; requests not built yet are refused "Not available yet." | Round trip, fuzz and golden tests for every new message and field; the golden refreshed under the next version; the host refuses each new request politely; every existing session test passes; quick check `--no-battery` (the new world variants are never sent). **Built (F2-0, 2026-10-05):** protocol 8; the messages in `wire/messages.rs` (`SettingsChange`, `Lock`, `SlotLock`, `Revival`, `Spawned`, `Scores`, `Results`, `Observe`, `Observing`, `EndReason::KillLimit`), the wing reply as command 22; `tore_session::settings` with the registry, typed choices (`Mode`, `Respawn`, `Fight`, `ScoreTally`, `KillOwner` and the rest) and the `Store` the host keeps and sends in every lobby state; the world's `Reply`, `Spawn`, `RevivalWeapons` and `score::Fact`; the host's hooks in `host/{king,revive,score,observe,away,results}.rs`, the take check calling `king_take_refusal` then `revive_take_refusal`; the client's senders and five new events. The step refuses `Abandon` and `Revive` and ignores `WingReply`. A lost plane's roster entry goes out as the AI's (agent decision: the roster has no "nobody"). Tests: `wire/phase2_tests.rs`, `client/phase2_seams_tests.rs`, `settings_tests.rs`, `world/phase2_seams_tests.rs` and the samples' round trip, fuzz and golden. The compile-only arms for the new variants in `tore-app` (`main.rs`, `net/play.rs`, `net/hosting.rs`, `net/debrief.rs`, the lobby preview), `tore-server`'s `wiring.rs` and `radio_calls.rs` are each one line |
| F2-C Friend-or-foe cues and the new keys | Sonnet | | `tore-app`: `main.rs` (the X's side), new `target_info.rs`, `flight_ui.rs` (U, Ctrl+T and the Pref row), `input_catalog.rs` (every phase 2 key: IFF, Show Target Info, score board, the four replies, each answering "network games only" until its slice lands), `docs/CONTROLS.md` (generated), `docs/tore-keyboard-map.html` | The X on the presented plane's side; IFF's answers; Show Target Info's labels and colours; the catalog rows | Unit tests: the X for a viewer on each side; IFF for friendly, other and none; label text, colours and callsigns from a fixture picture and roster; the controls list test; a headless render of the labels; the menus lane's "Show target info" row no longer reports not implemented; quick guard. **Built (F2-C, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#friend-or-foe); unit tests for the X on each side (and on a friendly and a hostile runway), IFF's three answers, label text, colours, callsigns, the cap and a headless render; the catalog rows and the controls test; a windowed `replay-script-friend-or-foe` scenario (the replay lane's input scripts) that presses U, Ctrl+T, K and a reply key in single player and compares a frame before and after for the orange text. Single-player change as planned (John, 2026-10-05): the full baseline was recorded and every difference explained in the run's notes |
| F2-1 The King's lobby | Opus | F2-0 | `host/king.rs`, `host/config.rs`, `host/lobby.rs`, `host/discover.rs`, new `host/king_tests.rs`, `client/lobby_tests.rs` additions; `tore-world` `mission.rs` (`friendly_fire`, the loadout rule) and `world/build.rs`; `tore-server` `config.rs` and `wiring.rs`; `docs/DEDICATED-SERVER.md` | The settings store's King's changes with their phase rules; mode and slots; slot locks; join in progress; lock sides; max players, password and visibility; the loadout rule; friendly fire into the spec; house and crown, passing it, the King's departure; a server's King; the server's configuration keys for every setting | Simulator tests: each setting reaches every lobby state; a non-King and a wrong phase are refused; PvP opens both sides; closed and reserved slots; join in progress off; lock sides; the loadout rule; friendly fire off in a flown mission; the crown passed, used and passed on at a departure; the house's leaving ends the game and the King's does not; a server's first-player King; configuration parsing. A `net` lane scenario: a `tore-server` with `king first-player` and a King bot that changes settings and starts. Single-player baseline SAME. **Built (F2-1, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#the-kings-lobby-as-built-f2-1): the crown and the house, the settings' checks and phase rules, mode and slots, slot locks, join in progress, lock sides, the limit, password and visibility (a hosted game's thread lists it while public), the loadout rule and friendly fire in the mission, a server's first-player King, `king-mission locked` and its return to the file; the server's keys for every setting (`mode`, `kill-limit`, `observer-delay` and the rest, `king`, `king-mission`); the host log's crown, settings, lock and watch lines; `tore-bot --king`. Tests: `host/king_tests.rs` (16 on the simulator), `host/config.rs`, `settings_tests.rs`, `mission.rs` (the lines, the rule, the build), `tore-server` `config.rs`, `tore-bot`'s options, a hosting thread test of the visibility; the net lane's `net-server-king`, `net-server-pvp` (a kill limit in PvP; slice BOT's pilot lands the kill that ends it, where this slice's bots rarely did and the time limit ended it in a draw) and `net-server-delay`. Single-player baseline SAME |
| F2-R Orders and replies | Sonnet | F2-0, F2-C, stage G's G3a and G8 | `tore-world` `world/replies.rs`, `radio_calls.rs`, `ai_wings/orders.rs`, the comms delivery; the app's handling of the four reply actions; `tore-bot --reply` | The order call to human wingmen; the reply calls and their refusals | World tests on the crowd fixture: a human lead's order reaches its human wingman as a call and a line, and nobody else; each reply reaches the flight's humans only, respects radio silence, and a lead's reply is refused; the radio journal; a `net` scenario with two bots in one wing exchanging an order and a reply. Single-player baseline SAME. **Built (F2-R, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#orders-to-human-wingmen-and-their-replies): `World::wing_reply` and `World::call_human_wingmen` (`world/replies.rs`), `Radio::reply` (`radio_calls.rs`), `OrderReport::humans` and the lead's voice for human-only orders (`ai_wings/orders.rs`), the human wingman's call in a sort (`world/commands_sort.rs`), `Cause::Replied` (`comms/journal.rs`), the seat cooldown key `radio-reply` in the comms checkpoint's table, the app's four keys sending the call (`main.rs`, `flight_ui.rs`), and `tore-bot --order` and `--reply` with its radio and HUD lines. No wire change (protocol 13 already carried `WingReply`). Single-player baseline SAME against `m2r-g6-final` (316 same, none different or missing; the guard's 52 too) |
| F2-S Scoring | Opus | F2-0 | `tore-world` `score.rs` and its call in `world.rs`; `tore-sim` combat's `Strike` amount; `host/score.rs`, new `host/score_tests.rs`; the client's scores; `tore-app` new `net/scoreboard.rs` and its call in `net/play.rs` | Score facts; tallies; limits and the kill limit's end; Scores; the score board on K | World tests: a human killed with the pilot aboard counts two, after ejecting one, ground kills none, damage fractions, losses, AI shooters; host tests for each tally, fight type and owner, the kill limit's end with its winner and a draw, the time limit, the pace; a render test of the board. Single-player baseline SAME (facts off). **Built (F2-S, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#scoring); the world's facts (`score.rs`, combat's `Strike::amount`), the host's tallies, limits, winner and pace (`host/score.rs`), the client's kept scores and their words (`client/scores.rs`), `tore-bot`'s scores lines, and K's board (`net/scoreboard.rs`, two short hunks in `main.rs`: the K arm and the draw call). Tests: `world/score_tests.rs` (a real gun burst's damage, kill and loss; ejection; AI shooters; no shooter; ground kills and fractions; recording changes nothing the mission does), `host/score_tests.rs` (on the simulator: kills, losses, damage, ratio, both fights, the kill limit by side, total and player with a winner and a draw, the time limit's winner, co-op, the pace, a late joiner and a departure), `client/scores.rs` (the words, and the real client keeping and counting down), the board's lines and a headless render, and the net lane's `net-server-scores` |
| F2-V Death and revival | Opus | F2-0 | `tore-world` `world/revive.rs`, `world/handoff.rs`, `ai_wings.rs` (the spawned aircraft), new `world/revive_tests.rs`; `host/revive.rs`, new `host/revive_tests.rs`; the client's revival state and its own copy's spawn; `tore-app` `net/play.rs` (the prompt and Enter); `tore-bot --revive` | Abandon and Revive; the revival point and loadout; retiring; lives, delay and the three rules; Join after a loss; replaces the host's orphans | World tests: a revived plane's place, heading, speed, stores under each weapons rule and its handoff invariants; Abandon keeps a wreck falling; 100 revivals in one mission stay within 64 planes; host tests for each rule, lives, the delay, the lobby's Join, lock sides; a client copy that adds the spawned plane; a `net` scenario where a bot ejects, revives and flies on. Single-player baseline SAME. **Built (F2-V, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#death-revival-and-lives); Abandon and Revive, the revival point, the loadout and the weapons rule, retiring and the `Book` in `world/revive.rs` (with a new aircraft for the AI in `ai_wings.rs`, three roster calls in `seats.rs`, and in `world.rs` the field, Abandon in the input check, the lost planes' neutral input and silent radios, and the wrecks' rest each tick); the host's rules, lives, delay, held seats, Join after a loss and Spawned in `host/revive.rs`, replacing the orphans in `host/mod.rs`; the client's Revival, prompt and spawned planes (`client/revival.rs`); `tore-bot --revive`; the game's prompt and Enter (`net/play.rs`, one guard in `main.rs`). Tests: `world/revive_tests.rs` (the point, the stores under each rule, the handoff's invariants, Abandon's falling wreck, a client's copy, the 30 seconds, 100 revivals within 64 planes, the same twice), `host/revive_tests.rs` (each rule, lives, the delay, Join after a loss, lock sides, a late joiner, the held seat), `client/revival_tests.rs` and the prompt's words, the game's copies, the `net-server-revive` scenario (the server's file sets `respawn revive` by F2-1's keys), and for checkpoints `world/revive_checkpoint.rs` and the equivalence scenario "revivals and wrecks". The ai-slot rule keeps to F2-1's slot locks and lock sides but not to join in progress. A real-data run (dedicated server, a bot ejecting) revived the bot into plane 12 under `revive` and into plane 1 under `ai-slot` |
| F2-O1 The observer stream | Opus | F2-0 | `host/observe.rs`, new `host/observe_tests.rs`; the observer flight in `wire/connection.rs` and `wire/from_world.rs`; new `client/observe.rs`; `tore-bot --observe` | Observe and Observing, snapshots with no own plane, relevance by the camera, the delay ring | Simulator tests: an observer gets entities near its subject at the full rate and far ones twice a second; with a delay nothing newer than now less the delay is ever sent, events included; the stream stops at seating and at the end; bandwidth and the ring's memory measured and recorded; a `net` scenario with an observing bot. Quick guard. **Built (F2-O1, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#the-observer-view): the host's watches and stream (`host/observe.rs`, the hooks in `host/mod.rs`: the watch on each connection, the stream on the host, the stop before Seated and at the end, the lobby's observing mark), `from_world::observer_picture`, `HostConnection::observer_snapshot`, the client's `watch`, `stop_watching` and `observer_frame` (`client/observe.rs`), `Host::send_as_of` for the slices that send news at a tick, and `tore-bot --observe`. Delayed observers' snapshot ticks are the ring's (agent decision). Tests: `host/observe_tests.rs` (rates by the camera, a point and none, the camera's limit, refusals, human-flown planes and events, the delay for snapshots, events and held messages, the stops, measurements; the 60-second ring `#[ignore]`d for the full run), `client/observe_tests.rs`, `from_world`'s observer picture; the `net-server-observe` scenario. Measured: 8.4 MB at a 60-second delay for 30 aircraft; about 12 KB/s to an observer of 30 |
| F2-L The lobby screen | Sonnet | F2-1 | `tore-app` `lobby_screen/` (new `settings_panel.rs` and `players_panel.rs`), `ordnance.rs` (lobby Cheat loading under the rule), the lobby's glue in `net/` | Settings..., Players..., slot locks, the seven buttons, Watch, the head's summary, greying | `facts` tests for who may press what; headless renders of each Settings page as King and not; a windowed run (through `tools/agent-run.sh`) hosting with a bot: settings changed and seen by the bot, the crown passed and taken back, a slot closed. **Built (F2-L, 2026-10-05):** as [the lobby panels as built](#the-lobby-panels-as-built-f2-l); the seven buttons with Kick inside the Players panel, the Settings panel's four pages, the King's right click on a slot, Watch, the head's "Rules" line, Messages' lines for settings and locks, and Load Ordnance under the loadout rule. Tests: `lobby_screen/phase2_tests.rs`, `ordnance.rs`, twelve snapshot states, and the net lane's `net-window-lobby` (a window hosting with a bot: settings turned and seen by the bot, a slot closed and opened, the crown given and back). Single-player SAME |
| F2-D The multiplayer debrief | Sonnet | F2-S | `tore-world` `debrief.rs` (`results`); `host/results.rs`; the client's Results; `tore-app` `debrief.rs` and `net/debrief.rs` (the SCORES and RESULTS pages) | Results rows, the message at the end, the pages | A world test with rows for every plane, human and AI, retired included; a host test that every connection gets Results; headless renders of both pages with 30 aircraft; the existing single-player page tests unchanged; quick guard. **Built (F2-D, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#the-multiplayer-debrief): `debrief::results` and its rows, `host/results.rs`, the client's kept Results (`client/results.rs`) and `tore-bot`'s results line, the SCORES and RESULTS pages (`net/debrief.rs`, the `.columns` directive in `debrief.rs`, two lines in `net/play.rs` to hand them over), the `net-server-results` scenario. Single-player debrief unchanged (the full baseline is in the run's notes) |
| F2-A The AI flies an idle aircraft | Opus | F2-1, F2-O1 | `host/away.rs`, new `host/away_tests.rs`; away detection in `tore-app` `net/play.rs` and the banner; `tore-bot --away` | Away and Back, the stall's count, the reservation, the handoff both ways | Simulator tests: away for the setting's seconds hands the plane to the AI and reserves it; another player's take is refused; Back retakes it with its stores and damage; a stalled game the same; `never` does nothing; a `net` scenario with a bot away and back. **Built (F2-A, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#the-ai-flies-an-idle-players-aircraft): the host's Away and Back, its count of a game that sends nothing, the handoff with the player watching its plane, the reservation and its end (`host/away.rs`, hooks in `host/mod.rs`: the take refusal, `reserved`, the lobby's away mark, the empty timeout, the mission's end; three lobby log events in `host/lobby.rs`); the client's `ai_flies` and its once-only `away` and `back` (new `client/away.rs`, one hook in `client/mod.rs`); the game's count, flight inputs, banner and End Mission while away (new `net/away.rs`, short hunks in `net/play.rs` and `main.rs`); `tore-bot --away SECONDS,FOR`. Tests: `host/away_tests.rs` (7 on the simulator), `client/away_tests.rs` (4), the game's `net::away` (7), `tore-bot`'s option, the net lane's `net-server-away`. No wire change. Single player unchanged. **Closed (F2-O3, 2026-10-06):** the player who is away sees the AI fly its own plane on the observer screen, and takes it back at the first flight input there |
| F2-O2 The observer screen | Sonnet | F2-O1, F2-L, stage E's replays | `tore-app` new `net/observe.rs`; the viewer's live mode in `replay/`; the routing in `main.rs` | The live recording, the viewer's live mode, Watch and Esc | Tests of the growing recording, live, pause, scrub and End; a headless render; a windowed run watching a server with bots. Single-player replays byte-identical (the replay lane's `--changed` scenarios). **Built (F2-O2, 2026-10-05):** as [described above](#the-observer-view): the live recording (`net/observe.rs`: the feeder, the store thread and the watch), the viewer's live mode (`Viewer::open_live` and `grow`, the clock's live edge, the growing playback, track pass and sound), the seat-aware viewer that ends the conversion's id swap, Watch opening the screen and Stop Watching in the Escape menu leaving it, the camera's subject to the host, and a script's keys and `shot` reaching the viewer. Tests: `net::observe` (six, and the ignored ten-minute measurement), `replay::clock`, `playback`, `tracks`, `viewer` and `net_convert` additions, `client::convert_tests` and the net lane's `net-window-observe` (a window joins a server flown by two bots, presses Watch, and looks, scrubs and returns to live). Single-player baseline SAME (the recorder and the simulation are untouched; see the slice's baseline report). Not built: smoke, contrails and gun rounds, and rotating the file to ten minutes (smoke, contrails and gun rounds from E2's `NetEffects` need the feeder to give it the mission's world and the bursts as replay events). The away player's own plane on this screen is F2-O3's |
| F2-O3 An away player watches its own plane | Sonnet | F2-A, F2-O2 | `tore-app` `net/away.rs`, `net/observe.rs`, short hunks in `net/play.rs`, `main.rs` and `replay/host.rs`, and `Viewer::menu_open` in `replay/viewer.rs`; the net lane's `net-window-away-watch` | The observer screen opens on the player's own plane when the AI flies it, the flight's inputs are read there, the first one takes the plane back, Stop Watching | Unit tests of the keys and controllers read on the screen, the viewer's own keys left to it, who shows a watch, the idle rule's first Back; the net lane's windowed scenario: away behind the flight menu, the observer screen, taken back by the Up arrow, again, taken back by Stop Watching. Single player SAME (quick guard). **Built (F2-O3, 2026-10-06):** see [the observer screen for an away player's own plane](#the-observer-screen-for-an-away-players-own-plane-f2-o3) |

**What runs at once.** F2-0 and F2-C start together. Once F2-0 lands, F2-1,
F2-S, F2-V, F2-O1 and F2-R run in parallel (four Opus and one Sonnet): each
owns its own host module and test file, and the mission core's files split as
the table says. Their shared edges are small: `world.rs` (F2-S's call and
F2-V's fields), the client's `mod.rs` (event handling), `net/play.rs` (F2-S's
board, F2-V's prompt, later F2-A) and `tore-bot`'s options; each keeps those
diffs short and the later merge rebases. Then F2-L, F2-D and F2-A run together,
and F2-O2 last, once stage E's replays have merged.

**Beside stage G.** Stage G's slices edit some of the same files: G3a and G8
`world/commands.rs` (F2-0 adds one match arm there), G8 `comms.rs` and
`radio_calls.rs` (F2-R's), G3c and G8 the controls list and
`input_catalog.rs` (F2-C's), G6 `main.rs` and `weapon_hud.rs` (F2-C's X) and
G7 the wire (F2-0's). F2-R follows G3a and G8, since its order call extends
G's; for the others, whichever lands second rebases on the first, and the two
wire slices take the protocol versions the lead hands out in merge order. The
same holds beside stages I and J: J6 adds each player's connection path to
the lobby state and the lobby screen (F2-0's and F2-L's files), and stage I's
listing is driven by this design's `visibility` setting.

##### Questions for John

The design builds as written with these recommendations; each is John's to
change.

1. **Respawn rules.** The guide's "back at a base" becomes retail's revival:
   a new aircraft of the same type at the revival distance from the battle,
   airborne, with the revival weapons; beside it `ai-slot` (take a free AI
   aircraft of one's side) and `none`. A player whose plane was lost can no
   longer press Join for a free plane outside these rules. *Recommended.*
2. **Single player gains three retail features:** U answers IFF ("IFF:
   Friendly") instead of "IFF unavailable", Show Target Info (Pref row and
   Ctrl+T, off by default) works, and the reply keys say "You lead this
   flight." *Recommended: all three*; otherwise they are limited to networked
   flights.
3. **PvP defaults:** revival with unlimited lives, no delay, 10 nm, with
   missiles; by sides, total kills, kill limit 5 by one side, time limit 10
   minutes, sides locked. Co-op: no revival, no limits, friendly fire on.
   *Recommended as tabled.*
4. **The AI flies an idle aircraft** after 5 minutes away (menu, focus, a
   lost controller, a stall; 10 seconds when first proposed, changed by John
   on 2026-10-06), in co-op and PvP, as the King's setting with `never`
   available. *Recommended.*
5. **A dedicated server's King:** none by default (today's behaviour); a
   server's configuration may give the crown to the first player
   (`king first-player`) and may lock its mission. *Recommended.*
6. **Realism is fixed for the flight:** the King sets the mission's cheats in
   the lobby; nobody's Cheat menu changes them in flight, which keeps every
   client's prediction exact. This replaces the guide's gap-fill that gave the
   King the Cheat menu in flight. *Recommended.*
7. **Keys:** replies on Alt+Shift+E (Engaging), Alt+Shift+W (Winchester),
   Alt+Shift+B (Bingo fuel) and Alt+Shift+H (Need help); the score board on K;
   U and Ctrl+T as retail; Enter flies again after a loss, as retail.
   *Recommended.*

## Master server and connectivity

Design for stages I and J of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
taken together because a public list of games helps only hosts with an open
port until players can also reach each other through their routers. Written
by a design agent for the lead on 2026-10-05 from a survey of the
`multiplayer` branch at `884f9916`; not built, not yet reviewed by John.
Every choice is an *agent proposal* unless it is credited to John; John's
questions are collected by the lead. The specs that go with it:

- the master's wire: [master-protocol.md](formats/master-protocol.md);
- what the game's own transport adds: [net-protocol.md, through the master](formats/net-protocol.md#through-the-master-stages-i-and-j);
- running the master: [MASTER-SERVER.md](MASTER-SERVER.md);
- what players see and what is reported: the guide's
  [master server](MULTIPLAYER.md#master-server),
  [connection path](MULTIPLAYER.md#connection-path) and
  [telemetry](MULTIPLAYER.md#replay-and-telemetry).

In short:

- A new program, **`tore-master`**, standard library only, keeps the list of
  listed games, answers the game's **Internet Lobby** screen, introduces a
  joining player to a host, measures how each router maps the game port,
  relays the traffic of a pair that cannot reach each other, and counts
  anonymous telemetry. It runs as a systemd service on one small Linux
  machine (John, 2026-09-28: a Linode shared 2 GB plan, 1 TB a month).
- A host talks to the master **from its game port**, and a joining player
  from the socket it joins with, so the master learns the outside address of
  the very socket the game uses. A small router in front of the transport,
  `tore_net::master::Rendezvous`, takes the master's datagrams out of the
  game port's stream and wraps relayed traffic; the transport, the session
  and the game's screens are unchanged by it.
- A joining player tries every address it is given for the host at once
  (local, mapped, IPv6, as the master saw it), while the host punches back.
  After 3 seconds without an answer it asks the master for the relay, through
  which the same handshake and session run.
- A hosting game asks its router to forward the game port (UPnP, NAT-PMP or
  PCP), so most hosts are reachable without any of the rest.
- Direct Connection does not change: it never talks to the master.
- Single player does not change.

### Surveys behind the design

A read-only survey of the code at `884f9916`, line numbers indicative:

- **The transport knows a peer by its address.** `tore_net::Server` keeps
  its connections in `entries: BTreeMap<SocketAddr, Entry>` (`server.rs`)
  and its cookies and rate limits key on the address too. Every relayed
  player would arrive from the master's one address, so a relayed player
  needs an address of its own: the in-process link already solved this with
  a reserved address no UDP sender can have, `LINK_ADDRESS` (`link.rs`).
- **Everything reads through one trait.** `Host::receive_from`,
  `Client::receive_from` and the transport's own helpers take
  `&mut impl Datagrams` (`datagram.rs`), and the hosting game already wraps
  its socket in a decorator, `Linked<ServerSocket>` (`link.rs`), which reads
  the link first and drops datagrams that claim the link's address. A router
  for the master's datagrams and the relay is one more decorator of the same
  kind.
- **The host's port is dual-stack.** `ServerSocket::bind(Listen::Any, port)`
  (`socket.rs`) gives one IPv6 socket that takes IPv4 on Linux and macOS and
  two on Windows, on one port. The dedicated server holds one in
  `crates/tore-server/src/wiring.rs`; the hosting game's thread
  (`crates/tore-app/src/net/hosting.rs`, `serve`) holds a
  `Linked<ServerSocket>`. Both loops are receive, update, transmit, wait.
- **A joining game binds one family.** `Join::to` (`net/session.rs`) binds
  `0.0.0.0:0` or `[::]:0` by the server's family; `reach::probe` uses a
  socket of its own; `net::lookup::Lookup` tries a name's addresses one after
  another, three seconds each. An introduction must try several addresses of
  both families at once, from the socket the session then uses.
- **The summary exists.** `Host::discover_answer` (`tore-session`'s
  `host/discover.rs`) builds the game's name, mission, players, King,
  capacity, password flag and phase for discovery, and
  `DiscoverAnswer::fit` (`tore-net`'s `packet.rs`) cuts it to a length. A
  listing is the same facts.
- **The keepalive thread sends a ready datagram.** `Keepalive::start`
  (`keepalive.rs`) takes a clone of the game's socket, the host's address and
  the bytes to send; a relayed game gives it a socket wrapper that frames
  for the relay instead.
- **The simulator routes by address only.** `sim::SimNetwork` (`sim.rs`)
  delivers a datagram to the inbox bound at its destination; there is no
  translation, so routers must be added to it.
- **The screen is a stub.** The Multi menu's second row, *Internet Lobby...*,
  answers "coming soon" (`menu.rs`, the toast branch for bar 2). The Direct
  Connection screen (`direct_screen/`), its search loop (`net/search.rs`,
  `Search`, `GameList`, `Compat`), the widget kit (`widgets/`) and the title
  bar with a player's own lettering (`widgets/header.rs`) are all reusable.
- **No interface list.** The standard library cannot list a machine's
  addresses. EF5 found its own network address by pointing an unconnected UDP
  socket at a far address and reading the address the system chose
  (`net/search.rs`, `own_network_address`); the same works for IPv6.
- **No HTTP.** UPnP needs HTTP/1.1 and XML over TCP. `std::net::TcpStream`
  with bounded reads is enough for the few requests a router answers.

### Crates and modules

One new crate. Everything is standard library only; no new dependency.

| Where | Kind | Holds | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tore-master` (new) | binary, with a library for its tests | The master: `Master`, a state machine that, like the transport, never reads a clock or touches a socket; its listings, browse, probes, introductions, relay and telemetry; the configuration, the run loop on two UDP ports, logs, statistics and the `flood` load tool | tore-net, tore-codec |
| `tore-net`, module `master` (new) | library | The master's packets (`packet.rs`), addresses and candidates (`candidate.rs`), the `Rendezvous` and its router (`rendezvous.rs`, `routed.rs`), the game's own addresses (`local.rs`), a host's side of introductions and relays (`meet.rs`, `relay.rs`), a player's side (`join.rs`) and the browse client (`browse.rs`) | tore-codec |
| `tore-net`, module `portmap` (new) | library | UPnP (SSDP and IGD over HTTP), NAT-PMP and PCP; blocking, for a thread of its own | std only |
| `tore-net`, module `sim` | library | Gains routers (`sim/nat.rs`): address translation, filtering, nesting, IPv6 firewalls, static forwards | |
| `tore-net`, the transport | library | The Punch packet, `Client::connect_any`, the path in the Challenge answer (*built, J2*; the punches are sent by the host's rendezvous, so no `Server::punch`) | |
| `tore-session` | library | The next protocol versions; the lobby's player list carries the path; the bot joins through the master | |
| `tore-server` | binary | Settings `broadcast` (John's name for the design's `list`), `master`, `telemetry`, `port-mapping`; the console's `broadcast on` and `broadcast off` | |
| `tore-app` | binary | The Internet Lobby screen (`internet_screen/`), its browse loop (`net/browse.rs`), telemetry (`net/telemetry.rs`), the hosting thread's rendezvous and port mapping, the joined session's rendezvous | |

`tore-master` depends on nothing of the game's simulation or data: it never
reads the import, so the machine that runs it needs no copy of Fighters
Anthology, and nothing derived from retail media ever reaches it.

### The master

`tore-master` is one process on one thread. Its loop reads at most 1,024
datagrams from each of its two ports, hands each to `Master::receive(now,
port, from, bytes)`, calls `Master::update(now)` for its timers (expiry,
retries, relay idle, statistics), sends what `Master::poll_transmit` gives,
and sleeps a millisecond when there was nothing to do (agent decision: a
portable loop, measured in I2; a relay frame waits at most that long). Its
two ports are `ServerSocket`s on `Listen::Any`, so it serves IPv4 and IPv6 on
each.

| Module | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `master.rs` | `Master`: the dispatch of every packet kind, the cookie key, the queue out |
| `listings.rs` | Listings by id and by token, their summaries, sources, expiry; the page order |
| `limits.rs` | Token buckets per source (an IPv4 address or an IPv6 /64) and in all, the table of sources with its bound, the answer-size rule |
| `browse.rs` | Browse pages and details |
| `probe.rs` | Probe answers on both ports |
| `introduce.rs` | Introductions, Meets and their retries, hints |
| `relay.rs` | Channels, keys, rates, idle, the monthly allowance and its file |
| `telemetry.rs` | Reports into daily counts, with a salt for distinct installs that is drawn each day and never written down |
| `stats.rs`, `log.rs` | A status line every minute and a daily table of counts ([operations](MASTER-SERVER.md#logs-and-statistics)) |
| `config.rs` | The configuration file, refused line by line as the server's is |
| `run.rs`, `main.rs` | The real loop, `--config`, `--check-config`, `flood` |
| `flood.rs` | `tore-master flood TARGET SECONDS`: a load tool that sends every kind of request from many source ports and reports what came back, so an operator can see the limits hold |

Bounds: at most 2,000 listings, 65,536 remembered sources, 64 relay
channels, a few thousand introductions under way (each forgotten after 30
seconds). With every table full it holds a few tens of megabytes.

**Built (I2, 2026-10-05)** as above, with these agent decisions:

- **The limits are generic cell rate buckets** (`limits.rs`): each keeps the
  time at which it is empty again, in integer time, so the same requests
  give the same answers on every system. A source is an IPv4 address or an
  IPv6 /64. Over a limit the request is dropped; the log says so once a
  minute per source.
- **The total answer rate drops the busiest first.** Every answer is
  charged to `answer-rate` (5,000 a second, a second's burst). Once half of
  it is spent, only a *quiet* source, one that has used at most half its own
  burst, is answered, so a flood is dropped before a player who asks now and
  then. That is how the design's "oldest source first" reads in the build.
- **Every answer is fitted to its request and never longer**, whoever sent
  it, not only to unproven senders (`Master::answer_in` encodes within the
  request's length). Unsupported, Unknown listing and the answers to Browse
  and Details share the source's browse bucket.
- **Heartbeats and Keeps share one bucket per listing**: one every 2
  seconds with bursts of 2, so a Heartbeat and a Keep falling due together
  both count. Unregister needs only the token and is never answered.
- **The host's mapping type comes from its probes.** Register carries no
  mapping type, but the Page's relay mark (and J2's hint) needs one, so the
  master pairs the two Probes of one test by their nonce and the sender's IP
  address, and keeps the verdict for 15 minutes under the address its main
  port saw (`probe.rs`). A game sends the same nonce to both ports (the
  [mapping test](formats/master-protocol.md#mapping-test)), and the second
  probe to the main port + 1. Seeing the host at one of its own Local or
  Global IPv6 candidates means no translation.
- **The browse cursor is an offset** into the sorted matches (at most 200);
  a list that changes between pages can repeat or skip a game until the
  next refresh. The browse client (`tore_net::master::browse::Browser`)
  drops repeats when it puts the pages together.
- **The console and the stop.** `status`, `listings` and `quit` on standard
  input; Ctrl+C and SIGTERM end the process at once, since catching a
  signal needs unsafe code. The telemetry file and the minute table are
  written every minute ([operations](MASTER-SERVER.md#running-it)).
- **The flood tool's second source.** On loopback it asks for the list from
  127.0.0.2, a second source to the master; against a master elsewhere that
  check is skipped ([the flood tool](MASTER-SERVER.md#the-flood-tool)).
- **The idle loop** costs 0.7 percent of one core in a debug build on the
  development machine (10 idle seconds, `/proc` CPU ticks), so the
  millisecond sleep stays.
- `tore-master` depends on `tore-net` only; `tore-codec` comes through it.
  `log.rs` holds the state folder's files and their UTC dates; `stats.rs`
  the status line and the minute table. `introduce.rs` was built by J2 and
  `relay.rs` by J3 ([the relay](#the-relay)).

### One socket, two protocols

A host's game port carries its players' traffic and the master's; a joining
player's socket carries the host's and the master's. The game keeps one
`Rendezvous` per socket that talks to the master, and reads and writes the
socket through it:

```rust
// tore_net::master (sketch; names are proposals)
pub struct Rendezvous { /* role, master addresses, listing or introduction, channels */ }

impl Rendezvous {
    pub fn host(config: HostRendezvous, now: Duration) -> Self;
    pub fn joiner(config: JoinRendezvous, now: Duration) -> Self;
    /// The socket as the transport should see it, for one receive or transmit.
    pub fn over<'a, D: Datagrams>(&'a mut self, socket: &'a mut D, now: Duration) -> Routed<'a, D>;
    /// Timers: heartbeats, keeps, retries, the race, relay idle.
    pub fn update(&mut self, now: Duration);
    /// The master's datagrams this side wants to send.
    pub fn transmit<D: Datagrams>(&mut self, socket: &mut D) -> io::Result<()>;
    pub fn poll_event(&mut self) -> Option<RendezvousEvent>;
    // A host's: set_summary, set_mapped, set_listed, report.
    // A player's: candidates, choose_relay, path.
}
```

What `Routed` does:

| Datagram | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| Received from one of the master's addresses (either port, either family), not a Relay frame | The rendezvous, never the transport |
| Received from the master, a Relay frame of an open channel | The transport, as a datagram from the channel's relayed address ([net-protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#relayed-addresses)) |
| Received from a real socket claiming an address in `100::/64` | Dropped and counted, as `Linked` drops a claim of `LINK_ADDRESS` |
| Anything else received | The transport, unchanged |
| Sent by the transport to a relayed address | A Relay frame to the master |
| Sent by the transport to anything else | The socket, unchanged |

The hosting game's thread reads `Linked<ServerSocket>` through it, so the
link is still read first and a flood on the socket never holds back the
local player. Both host loops change by a line each:

```rust
host.receive_from(now, &mut rendezvous.over(&mut transport, now))?;
host.update(now);
rendezvous.set_summary_if_changed(|| host.discover_answer(0));
rendezvous.update(now);
host.transmit(&mut rendezvous.over(&mut transport, now))?;
rendezvous.transmit(&mut transport)?;
```

The master's address is looked up by name on a thread (the master may have
both an A and an AAAA record), again every 10 minutes and after the master
falls silent; until it is known the rendezvous sends nothing.

### Addresses and candidates

What each end tells the master about itself ([candidates](formats/master-protocol.md#common-fields)):

- **Local:** its own IPv4 address on the network that leads to the master,
  found by pointing an unconnected UDP socket at the master's IPv4 address
  and reading the address the system chose (no packet is sent), as
  `own_network_address` does toward a documentation address today. With the
  game port for a host, the socket's port for a player.
- **Global IPv6:** the same toward the master's IPv6 address, kept when it is
  in `2000::/3`. Taken this way it is the address the system will also send
  from, which matters when the system uses temporary privacy addresses: a
  host's firewall opens for the address it sends from.
- **Mapped:** the outside address a router's port mapping gave
  ([port mapping](#port-mapping)).
- **Seen:** the master fills in where it saw the packet come from.

A joining player's socket is a `ServerSocket::bind(Listen::Any, 0)` (stage J,
agent decision): one port, both families on every system, so its IPv4 and
IPv6 candidates and its Connect requests all leave from the same port.

### Listing a game

A host lists when it is told to: the Internet Lobby's **New** (stage I), a
dedicated server with `broadcast on` (John, 2026-10-05, off by default), `tore-app --host FILE --list`, and later the
King's Visibility setting (stage F phase 2: *public* lists, *private* does
not, *password* lists with the lock). The hosting thread takes
`Command::SetListed(bool)` so the lobby can change it while the game runs.

1. The rendezvous looks up the master and runs the
   [mapping test](formats/master-protocol.md#mapping-test).
2. It registers, answers the Challenge, and is Listed: the game reads
   "Listed on the Internet Lobby as 'Friday night'." and, for a host whose
   port is reachable, the address the master saw.
3. Every 30 seconds a Heartbeat carries `Host::discover_answer`, and 5
   seconds after a lobby change one more, at most one every 5 seconds; every
   15 seconds a Keep holds the router's mapping open.
4. An Unknown listing (the master restarted) means register again at once.
   No answer to anything for 10 seconds means the master is silent: the game
   reads "The Internet Lobby does not answer, so the game is not listed.
   Players can still join by address." and tries again after 2, 4, 8 and up
   to 60 seconds.
5. Stopping, or unlisting, sends Unregister three times.

The rendezvous reports to the hosting thread, which passes it to the game as
`Report::Listing(state)` (listed with the seen address, unlisted with why,
master silent) and to its log; `tore-server` prints it on its start and
status lines and in its log.

### The Internet Lobby screen

*Internet Lobby...* on the Multi menu opens it. It is the Direct Connection
screen's sibling: the same `NETIPX3` background, panel, widgets and
rectangles, with the title bar's lettering reading INTERNET LOBBY (a shipped
`assets/internet-lobby-title.png`, made the way the Direct Connection
lettering is, or the player's own `InternetLobby.png` in the data folder).

| Element | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Callsign | Shared with Direct Connection |
| Games | The listings, paged with PREV/NEXT and "PAGE n of m": the lock, the name, players over capacity, *Lobby*, *Flying* or *Closed*, and a small relay mark ("R") when the master expects the relay; another build dimmed with its version, not joinable |
| Players | The selected game's players, with the King's crown, from its details |
| Mission line | The selected game's mission summary |
| Show full games, Show other versions | Check boxes; the first is shared with Direct Connection |
| Messages | What the screen is doing: asking, how many games, the join's steps, refusals |
| New | Host a listed game from the Quick Mission creator's mission, as Direct Connection's New does, and open the lobby |
| Join | Join the selected game ([joining through the master](#joining-through-the-master)) |
| Refresh | Ask for the list again now (F5 does too) |
| Options | Port, password, game name (shared with Direct Connection), the master's address, "Forward the game port on my router", "Let my game take over hosting" (K7b) and "Send anonymous statistics" |
| Cancel | Back to Choose Activity |

- The list is asked for when the screen opens and every 15 seconds while it
  is open; the selected game's details every 5 seconds. Asking is a
  `net::browse::Browse` like the search's `Search`: a socket of its own, the
  `tore_net::master::Browser` state machine, `update(now)` every frame,
  events for added, changed and dropped games. It never blocks a frame.
- The first time the screen opens it writes one line about telemetry in
  Messages: "This game sends anonymous statistics to the Internet Lobby. Turn
  them off in Options." (John: on by default, with a switch and a one-time
  notice).
- When the master cannot be reached the list stays empty and Messages says
  so; Direct Connection still works.
- `tore-app --browse SECONDS [--master ADDRESS]` lists the games headlessly,
  as `--find-games` does for the local network.
- Snapshot states for the menus lane: `internet`, `internet-games`,
  `internet-joining`, `internet-options`, `internet-unreachable`.

Join runs [joining through the master](#joining-through-the-master): the
mapping test, the introduction, and a race of every address the master gives
for the host while the host punches back (J2), then the relay when the race
finds nothing, with a Messages line for each step (J5).

**Built (I4, 2026-10-05):** `internet_screen/` (`mod.rs` the screen and its
rules, `options.rs` the panel, `app.rs` the game's side, `preview.rs` the
headless states), `net/browse.rs` (the browse loop, `MasterJoin` and `--browse`), `net/telemetry.rs` (the install id, the notice, a player's
Report), the Internet Lobby's keys in `net/settings.rs`
(`network-v1.conf`: `master`, `show-other`, `port-forward`, `telemetry`,
`telemetry-notice`), and the title lettering in `widgets/header.rs`. Agent
decisions:

- **Join uses J2's joiner, from the screen.** A Page and a game's Details
  carry no address, so Join starts a `net::browse::MasterJoin`: a new
  dual-stack socket and a `tore_net::master::join::Joiner` on it, which run
  the mapping test and the Introduce from the very socket the session then
  joins with (the host's punches open the player's router for that address).
  On the master's Introduction the screen hands the socket and joiner to
  `NetSession` as `Transport::Internet` (`net::session::MasterTransport`,
  read and written through `Joiner::over`) with the introduction's
  `Race`, and `Client::connect` races the host's addresses (`ClientConfig::race`).
  Messages: "Asking the Internet Lobby to introduce you to 'X'...", "Trying 3
  addresses for 'X'...", then the game's "Joining X...", and "Connected
  directly (punched through)." (or the local network, IPv6, a forwarded port;
  "through the relay" waits for J3) once the lobby has the player. A refusal
  is the master's own words; a silent master (six tries) reads "The Internet
  Lobby did not introduce you to that game." The framed keepalive, the
  relay request after 3 seconds, the 15-second give-up and the Messages lines
  of each step after the introduction were left for J5, which built them
  ([joining through the master](#joining-through-the-master)); J5 also moved
  the "Connected ..." line from this screen's report into the session.
- **The list**: the master's order with the games that cannot be joined
  (another version, full, closing) after those that can, each group in the
  master's order; the check boxes also filter on the screen so a game
  appears or goes at once, and ask the master again with the new filters.
- **Refresh and F5**, a **Refresh** button between Join and Options (five
  buttons in a row at x 45, 161, 277, 393 and 509).
- **Messages**: a count is said when it changes (not each game found), a
  silent master or a name that does not resolve once until it answers
  again.
- **Statistics.** The install id is `install-id` in the data folder, drawn
  the first time it is wanted while statistics are on and deleted when they
  are turned off. A game listed from here (New) and one listed from the
  command line (`--host FILE --list`) carry it, so a listed game's hosting
  thread sends its Report; a game started from the command line says the
  notice on the console and the log the first time instead of a screen. A
  player who joins through the screen sends one Report when the session ends
  if it reached its lobby, from a thread of its own, once, with the path
  told from the host's address (local network or by address) until stage J
  reports the path really taken, and the time from pressing Join to the
  master's answer. Turning statistics off in Options deletes the id; turning
  them on again draws a new one.
- **Options** keeps the master's address (empty is the built-in one,
  `master.jroverton.com:26901`), the port-forward switch (read by every
  hosted game since J4b) and the statistics switch in
  `network-v1.conf`, which Direct Connection shares; the password is never
  kept.
- **Shared pieces**: the kit is Direct Connection's (the Internet Lobby
  builds it when it is first, and Direct Connection and the lobby screen
  find it in `direct_screen::app::Direct`), the lobby screen opens over
  either, and `Action::Internet` and `Action::InternetClose` open and close
  it.
- **Outside the row's file list** (small hunks the build needed):
  `direct_screen/app.rs` (`Direct::keep_kit`), `direct_screen/tests.rs` (the
  Multi menu test's second row), `net/play.rs` (a message and the Connected
  line reach this screen), `net/session.rs` (`Transport::Internet`: the
  introduced socket, its joiner and the race), `widgets/{kit,panel}.rs` (a
  title per screen),
  `tools/battery_scenarios/{net,menus}.py`, `tools/battery_selection.py`,
  and `tore-master` as a dev-dependency of `tore-app` for the tests.
- Tests: the screen's rules on the synthetic kit, the browse loop and the
  join's introduction against the real master on 127.0.0.1, `net-master-listing` (extended
  with `tore-app --browse`) and `net-window-internet` (the screen driven in a
  window against a listed server: the list, a game selected, New with a second
  `--browse` that sees the game, then Join through the master to the server,
  a plane, Ready and a few seconds of flight).

- The joined session's transport becomes `Transport::Internet`: the
  dual-stack socket and a joiner `Rendezvous`. `tore_session::Client` is
  started with every candidate through `Client::connect_any`
  ([net-protocol](formats/net-protocol.md#joining-from-several-addresses-at-once)).
- Messages, one line per step: "Asking the Internet Lobby to introduce you
  to 'Friday night'...", "Trying 3 addresses...", "Connected directly (IPv6)."
  or "No direct path; asking for the relay...", "Connected through the
  relay.", or the refusal's own text.
- The whole join gives up after 15 seconds, the relay's three included.
- `tore-bot --master ADDRESS --listing NAME [--path auto|direct|relay]` joins
  the same way headlessly; `--path relay` asks for the relay at once (for
  tests on one machine, where every direct path works).

*Built (J2, 2026-10-05) up to the race.* A player's side is
`tore_net::master::join::Joiner`: given the master's addresses and the
player's own candidates, it runs the mapping test, asks for the
introduction with its cookie, and hands over the host's addresses as the
race's `Target`s with their paths ([as built](formats/master-protocol.md#introductions-as-built)).
Its socket is read through `Joiner::over`, a router of its own beside the
host's `Routed` (agent decision; J3 has the two share their code). The session's
`ClientConfig::race` starts `tore_session::Client` with `connect_any`, and a
capture records the race so it replays. `tore-bot --master --listing`
finds the listing by name, joins each bot from a dual-stack socket of its
own and prints each step and the path.

*Built (J3, 2026-10-05): the relay.* `Joiner::ask_relay` sends the Relay
request and the offer opens the channel (`JoinEvent::Relayed` with the
channel's relayed address) or refuses it with its text; the game then
joins that address with an ordinary `Client::connect`, the path reading
"relay". `tore-bot --path auto` asks for the relay when the race has found
nothing in 3 seconds, or at once on the master's hint, and joins through it
if the race has still found nothing when the channel opens (otherwise it
closes the channel); `--path relay` asks at once and never races. The
punching table's four relay rows connect through the relay
(`tests/punch.rs`): 0.9 seconds from the player's first Probe with the
hint, 3.9 seconds after the race's 3.

*Built (J5, 2026-10-05): the game.* The Internet Lobby screen's part ends at
the master's introduction (I4); from there the session runs the join.
`net::session::MasterTransport` holds the introduced socket and joiner, the
race, the master's hint, the path allowed and the time the introduction took,
and `NetSession::pump` gives it a turn after the client's: the joiner's
timers and the master's answers, the relay asked for, the client started
again on the relay, the give-up, the channel closed. What the build settled
(agent decisions unless credited to John):

```

- **The Messages lines**, one per step: the screen's "Asking the Internet
  Lobby to introduce you to 'X'..." and "Trying 3 addresses for 'X'...", the
  game's "Joining X...", then the session's own lines as notices, which reach
  Messages the way the host's notices do: "No direct path; asking for the
  relay..." (or "The Internet Lobby says only the relay reaches this game;
  asking for the relay..." on the hint), "The relay is open; joining through
  it...", and the path once the host accepts ("Connected directly
  (punched through).", "Connected through the relay.", and so on). A refused
  relay is the master's words; a silent one "The Internet Lobby did not
  answer the relay request." Both leave the race running until it ends.
- **The relay joins with a new client**, as `tore-bot` does: the race's
  client is dropped and a client with the same settings joins the channel's
  relayed address. The race's capture, which holds no game, is removed and a
  new one started; the net log goes on in the same file. A channel that
  opens after an address answered is closed at once.
- **The give-up.** The whole join ends 15 seconds after Join was pressed, the
  introduction's time included, with "Could not reach 'X' directly or through
  the relay." ("No answer from 'X' at any of its addresses." when the relay
  was never asked for). The same words replace "No answer from the server."
  when the client gives up first (10 seconds after it started).
- **The relay only, for tests on one machine.** `TORE_JOIN_PATH=relay` (or
  `direct`, or `auto`, the default) is read when the screen opens, as
  `tore-bot --path` is: the screen says "Joining 'X' through the relay only
  (TORE_JOIN_PATH=relay)...", the session asks for the relay at once, and its
  transport sends nothing to the host's own addresses, so the race cannot
  win. A refused relay then ends the join with the master's words. An
  environment variable, since a player never needs it.
- **A channel the master closes** in a game ends the session at once with
  the close's words ("The relay closed after 30 seconds with no traffic."),
  rather than after the connection's 5-second timeout. A session that ends
  closes its channel after its last datagrams went through it.
- **The framed keepalive** (John, 2026-10-05: a stalled relayed game stays
  connected): the keepalive thread of a join through the master sends on a
  clone of its socket, wrapped in J3's `RelayFraming` when the host is the
  relayed address.
- **One clock.** From the introduction on, the joiner, its router and the
  race run on the session's clock.
- **The path in the net log** is a `path` line of the game's own (seconds,
  `path`, the path's words, the host's address) written into the same
  `logs/net-DATE.tsv` when the host accepts the join, and the game's log
  says "Network: joined ADDRESS, path WORDS". *Corrected:* the design had the
  `connect` line gain the path, but `tore-session`'s client writes that line
  when it starts, before any address has answered.
- **The player's Report** carries the path the client took, its mapping
  type from the joiner's test, the kilobytes through the relay both ways and,
  as the Report defines it, the time from pressing Join to the handshake's
  end (I4 sent the time to the master's answer).
- Tests (`net/join_tests.rs`, in the normal suite, about 14 seconds): on
  127.0.0.1 with the real master, a hosting game's thread listed on it with
  its King, the Internet Lobby screen on the synthetic kit and the game's own
  `NetSession`: a listed game joined directly (the punched path, a plane, a
  flight, the lines in order, the `path` line in the net log); joined with
  the relay only (the relay's lines, a plane, a flight, the game's bytes
  through the relay, a 7-second stall held by framed keepalives, the channel
  closed on leaving); a master with its relay off ending the join in its
  words; a game that stopped after it was listed refused in a plain line; and
  the rules: when the relay is asked for, the 15-second give-up, the relay
  only sending nothing to the host. The windowed `net-window-internet-relay`
  joins a listed `tore-server` through a master's relay from the screen.

### Hole punching

On a Meet the host's rendezvous asks the transport to send a
[Punch](formats/net-protocol.md#punch) (`Server::punch(to, introduction)`) to
each of the player's candidates, five times 200 ms apart, and acknowledges
the Meet. At most 10 Meets a second are acted on. Leaving the host's router,
the punches open its mapping for the player's addresses; leaving the
player's router, the Connect requests open its mapping for the host's. Which
pairs of routers can meet this way, in the terms of RFC 4787 (how a router
maps a socket's outside port, and which senders it lets in), is what the J2
tests assert on the [simulator](#the-nat-simulator):

| Host's router | Player's router | Expected path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None, or a forwarded or mapped port | Any | Punched (or mapped) |
| One port for every destination, any filtering | One port for every destination, any filtering | Punched |
| One port for every destination, filtering by address only, or none | A new port for each destination | Punched: the host's punches open its router to the player's address, whatever port the player's router chose |
| One port for every destination, filtering by address and port | A new port for each destination | Relay |
| A new port for each destination | One port for every destination, filtering by address only, or none | Punched: the player learns the host's new port from its punch |
| A new port for each destination | One port for every destination, filtering by address and port | Relay |
| A new port for each destination | A new port for each destination | Relay, at once by the hint |
| Two routers, each one port for every destination | Any row above that punches | Punched |
| The same router as the player (both at home) | | Local: the local address answers first |
| A carrier's router that maps per destination, and no IPv6 | A router filtering by address and port | Relay |
| No NAT, IPv6 with a stateful firewall | No NAT, IPv6 with a stateful firewall | IPv6, punched through both firewalls |

*Built (J2, 2026-10-05):* `crates/tore-master/tests/punch.rs` runs every row
on the simulator with the real master, a host listing itself through its
rendezvous and a player's `Joiner` and race, at a 100 ms round trip. The
rows that punch connect in 320 to 550 ms from the player's first Probe,
along the row's path (the host's transport is told the same path); the
relay rows find no direct path in the race's 3 seconds, and two symmetric
routers get the hint at once. Agent decisions: the host's rendezvous sends
the punches itself, on the game port beside its master datagrams, so the
host loops are unchanged (the design's `Server::punch` is not needed); a
mapped port is reached as `mapped port` because the host's seen address is
its Mapped candidate there; the IPv6 row is tested with both ends also on
IPv4 behind routers that cannot punch, so only IPv6 connects. A home
network is faster than the way out and back in, so the at-home row's local
link is 1 ms.

### The relay

When the player asks, the master opens a channel, the host acknowledges it,
and the player gets the channel and its key. From then on:

- The player's transport sends to the channel's relayed address; `Routed`
  wraps each datagram in a Relay frame to the master; the master checks the
  key and the sender and forwards the frame to the host; the host's `Routed`
  unwraps it into a datagram from the same relayed address. The way back is
  the same.
- The player's keepalive thread (EF-K) gets a socket clone wrapped so that
  its Keepalive goes out as a frame (`ServerSocket::try_clone`, new, and a
  framing `Datagrams` wrapper in `master/relay.rs`).
- When the game connection ends, each end closes the channel; the master
  closes channels idle for 30 seconds, over their rate, or when the month's
  allowance is spent ([channel rules](formats/master-protocol.md#relay)).
- John, 2026-10-05: the relay is on; new channels are refused at 95
  percent of `relay-month-gb` (800 GB) and open ones closed at 100 percent;
  relayed peers are never the calculated host; a stalled relayed game stays
  connected through its framed keepalives.
- A relayed player's round trip is the player to the master to the host:
  where the master is matters, which is a question for John (the region).
- Cost, from the [plan's budget](multiplayer-plan.md#bandwidth-budget): about
  13 KB/s down and 2.6 KB/s up for a player in a full mission, about 60 MB
  an hour leaving the master, so 800 GB a month is about 13,000 relayed
  player-hours.

**Built (J3, 2026-10-05).** The master's side is `tore-master`'s
`relay.rs`; both ends' side is `tore_net::master::relay` (`Channels`,
`HostRelays`, `RelayFraming`), the relayed addresses
(`relayed_address`, `channel_of`) are in `routed.rs`, and a player's
requests are in `join.rs`. What the build settled (agent decisions unless
credited to John):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Player's Joiner
  participant M as Master
  participant H as Host's Rendezvous
  P->>M: Relay request (nonce, introduction)
  M->>H: Relay open (every 250 ms, 3 at most)
  H->>M: Relay open ack (listing token)
  M->>P: Relay offer: channel and key
  P->>M: Relay frame: Connect request
  M->>H: the same frame, unchanged
  H->>M: Relay frame: Challenge
  M->>P: the same frame, unchanged
  Note over P,H: The handshake and the session run on,<br/>each end's transport seeing [100::1:HHHH:LLLL]:0
```

- **One router for both ends.** The host's `Routed` and the player's
  `JoinRouted` share their code (`routed.rs`, `route_receive` and
  `route_send` over a `MasterSide`): a Relay frame from the master of an
  open channel, with its key and from the master's address that opened it,
  reaches the transport as a datagram from the channel's relayed address;
  a send there leaves as a frame; everything else is as I3 built it. The
  routers read into a buffer of their own, as long as the longest master
  datagram (1,232 bytes), so a frame is never cut by the transport's
  1,201-byte buffer.
- **The host** acknowledges a Relay open only while listed (the ack
  carries its token), again for a repeated open, keeps at most 64 channels,
  and forgets one with no frame either way for 60 seconds (twice the
  master's idle time, as its Relay close may be lost). The host loops are
  unchanged: the master's idle close ends a channel whose connection ended
  at the host (`Rendezvous::close_relayed` exists for a loop that wants to
  close at once), and the player's end closes its own.
- **The player** asks with `Joiner::ask_relay`, sends the request again once
  after 1.5 seconds (the master takes 2 a minute from one source) and calls
  the master silent 4 seconds after the first. `Joiner::close_relay` sends
  three Relay closes when the game connection ends.
- **The master** (`relay.rs`) checks a request against the introduction it
  names (its player address and nonce), then refuses, in order: the relay
  off, the allowance at 95 percent, 64 channels, 2 from the player's source,
  30 to the listing. A refusal is a Relay offer with the result and the
  player's words; a host that never acknowledges is a refusal 250 ms after
  the third Relay open. Relay opens and offers are not answers fitted to a
  request: each goes to an address a listing or an introduction proves, as
  the Meets do.
- **Rates.** 64 KB/s each way (1 KB is 1,000 bytes), bursts of twice that,
  counted over the frames' bytes in integer time; over it a frame is
  dropped. A channel over its rate in every second for 30 seconds is closed
  (reason 2): a game never comes near it (38 KB/s at most in stage D), so
  that is a flood.
- **The allowance** counts what the master sends in Relay frames with each
  datagram's IP and UDP headers (28 bytes over IPv4, 48 over IPv6), as the
  provider counts transfer. `relay-YYYY-MM.txt` in the state folder holds
  the month's figure, written every minute and at `quit`, read back at
  start; a new month starts at zero. 95 and 100 percent are each logged
  once a month.
- **Stopping.** `quit` closes every channel with Relay close reason 4 to
  both ends before the sockets close; Ctrl+C and SIGTERM cannot (the
  standard library cannot catch them), and the relayed games then time out
  as after any lost connection.
- **The keepalive thread's wrapper** is `RelayFraming`, made by
  `Joiner::keepalive_socket` around a clone of the joining socket
  (`ServerSocket::try_clone`): a send to the channel's relayed address goes
  to the master as a frame; it never reads.

### Port mapping

`tore_net::portmap::PortMapper` asks the router to forward the game port. It
blocks, for at most 5 seconds in all, so the hosting game runs it on a thread
of its own; the dedicated server runs it on start when `port-mapping on`.
*Built (J4):* the library, standard library only. *Built (J4b):* the hosts'
use of it, in [the hosts](#port-mapping-in-the-hosts-as-built-j4b).

- **Three protocols at once.** UPnP: an SSDP search (`M-SEARCH` to
  239.255.255.250:1900 for an InternetGatewayDevice, 2 seconds), the
  device's description over HTTP, then `GetExternalIPAddress` and
  `AddPortMapping` (UDP, the same outside port as the game port, a one-hour
  lease, or a lease of 0 for an old device that refuses others; on a
  conflict the next four ports are tried) on its `WANIPConnection` or
  `WANPPPConnection` service. NAT-PMP (RFC 6886) and PCP (RFC 6887) to the
  gateway on UDP 5351: PCP's MAP first, NAT-PMP when the gateway answers that
  it does not speak PCP. The first to succeed is used.
- **As built (J4, agent decisions).** UPnP and PCP each run on a scoped
  thread. The first to map claims the result; the other stops within 50 ms
  (every wait looks at a shared flag that often), and if it had mapped the
  port in the same instant it removes its own mapping, within one more
  second. The search asks for both IGD versions with `MX: 1` and is sent
  again once after a second without an answer. A device's description must
  come from the address that answered the search, and its control addresses
  must stay on that host, so an answer on the local network cannot send the
  game to another machine. `WANIPConnection` of the highest version is tried
  first, then `WANPPPConnection`. PCP and NAT-PMP repeat a request after
  250 ms, 500 ms, 1 s and 2 s. A PCP answer counts only from the gateway's
  address and port with the request's nonce, protocol and inside port.
  Every error reads as one line for the player; when every protocol fails,
  the most telling is kept (a second router, then taken ports, no outside
  address, a refusal, silence).
- **The gateway's address.** On Linux the default route in
  `/proc/net/route`, on Windows `route print`, on macOS and the BSDs `route
  -n get default` (each command read with `std::process::Command` and given
  a second), else the address that answered the SSDP search, else the local
  address with its last byte 1. *Corrected by J4 (agent decision):* the
  design put the SSDP answer first, but both RFCs send to the default
  router, which the system knows without waiting for the search, so PCP
  starts at once.
- **Behind a second router.** An outside address that is itself private or
  in the carriers' 100.64/10 means the mapping is on an inner router: it is
  removed, and the game says "Your router is behind another one, so the
  port could not be opened to the internet." UPnP and NAT-PMP ask for the
  outside address before mapping, so they map nothing then; PCP learns it
  in the mapping's answer and removes the mapping (agent decision). An
  outside address of 0.0.0.0, loopback or link-local means the router is not
  connected: "Your router has no internet address, so the port could not be
  opened."
- **IPv6.** PCP's MAP for the host's global IPv6 address opens the router's
  IPv6 firewall where the router allows it. UPnP's IPv6 firewall control is
  not tried. The IPv6 router comes from `/proc/net/ipv6_route` (with the
  interface's index for a link-local router), `route print -6` or `route -n
  get -inet6 default`; the request is asked alongside the IPv4 ones and
  reported apart from them.
- **Renewing and removing.** Renewed at half the lease; removed when hosting
  stops. A game that dies leaves a mapping that lapses within the hour.
  `PortMapper::renew` asks again by the protocol that made the mapping, and
  from the start for one that fails, within the same 5 seconds;
  `PortMapper::remove` takes at most 2 seconds. A mapper keeps one PCP nonce
  for its life, since a gateway refuses a known mapping asked for with
  another nonce until it lapses. Nothing is removed when a mapper is
  dropped (agent decisions).
- **Bounded.** HTTP bodies at most 64 KB and heads 16 KB, chunked bodies
  read, a minimal reader for the XML elements it needs (at most 20,000
  events, 64 deep), every read with a timeout; the parsers are fuzzed.
  Addresses in a router's answers must be literal: no name is looked up.
- **What the player sees.** In the lobby's Messages: "Your router forwards
  UDP port 26900 (UPnP). Friends can join at 203.0.113.5:26900.", or why not.
  The address is the game's Mapped candidate. Both lines are the
  `Display` of `Mapping` and `MapError`; `MapReport::telemetry` gives the
  report's port mapping value.
- **Tested against fakes.** `tore_net::portmap::fake` holds a UPnP device
  with its SSDP responder (`FakeUpnp`) and a PCP and NAT-PMP gateway
  (`FakeGateway`) on loopback, public as the simulator is, for the J4b
  tests. Every test points every target at them; none asks a real router.
- **Settings.** The game: "Forward the game port on my router" in both
  screens' Options, on by default (a question for John); it applies to every
  game the player hosts, from either screen, since a friend joining a Direct
  Connection game by address needs it as much. `tore-server`: `port-mapping`,
  off by default, since a server's port is normally forwarded by its owner.
  `tore-app --map-port SECONDS` maps, prints the result, waits and removes
  the mapping.

#### Port mapping in the hosts, as built (J4b)

`tore_net::portmap::keeper` is the thread a host keeps its mapping on, shared
by the game and the server: a `Keeper` runs a `PortMapper` on a thread of its
own and tells the host what came of it. Agent decisions unless credited.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant H as Host thread (or server loop)
  participant K as Keeper thread
  participant R as Router (UPnP, NAT-PMP, PCP)
  participant M as Master
  H->>K: start(port), when the socket is bound
  K->>R: map (at most 5 s)
  K-->>H: News::Mapped (lines, outside address, telemetry value)
  H->>M: Heartbeat with the Mapped candidate (set_mapped)
  loop at half the lease
    K->>R: renew
    Note over K,H: news only when the address or the result changes
  end
  H->>K: begin_stop, when hosting stops
  K->>R: remove (at most 2 s)
  K-->>H: News::Removed
```

- **Where it starts.** The game's host thread starts it when its socket is
  bound, so mapping runs while the mission builds. The server starts it with
  the host. A start that is refused (a port in use, a bad master address)
  asks the router nothing.
- **The switch.** "Forward the game port on my router" in both Options
  panels (Direct Connection's new in J4b, the Internet Lobby's from I4), kept
  as `port-forward` in `network-v1.conf`, on by default, read by every game
  the player hosts, from either screen or `--host`. `tore-server`'s
  `port-mapping on|off`, off by default.
- **The Mapped candidate.** `Rendezvous::set_mapped` (and
  `HostListing::set_mapped`) keeps the IPv4 mapping's outside address apart
  from the host's own candidates, so the master lookups that rebuild those
  do not lose it. A change raises the change counter and goes out in the
  next Heartbeat (within 5 seconds); the same address again changes nothing.
  The mapping test ignores a Mapped candidate when it looks for the
  machine's own address. An IPv6 mapping is not a Mapped candidate: the
  GlobalIpv6 candidate already is that address.
- **What the player reads.** The lobby's Messages, from the host thread's
  `Report::Forward`: "Your router forwards UDP port 26900 (UPnP). Friends can
  join at 203.0.113.5:26900.", or the library's one-line reason followed by
  "Friends outside your network may need the relay." (agent decision, John
  asked for plain failure words). The IPv6 line appears only when it
  worked. The server logs the same lines with "Port mapping:" in front. The
  hosting game's telemetry Report carries the "Port mapping" value
  (`MapReport::telemetry`).
- **Only a change is news, and a failure is asked again.** A renewal that
  keeps the address says nothing. After a failure the keeper asks again every
  10 minutes; a mapping with no end (an old device) is never renewed.
- **Stopping.** When the King or the window stops the game, the keeper is told
  to remove the mapping at once, so the removal runs while the players are
  told; the host thread waits for it at most 2.5 seconds before it reports
  its end. A mapping still being asked for when the game stops is removed as
  soon as the library returns, if the process is still running; otherwise it
  lapses with its lease. The server removes it in `stop`.
- **No test reaches a real router.** The only ways to the real router are
  `net::hosting::forward::choose` in the game and `wiring::mapping_choice` in
  the server, and both answer `None` in a test build (`cfg!(test)`), whatever
  the settings file says. A test that needs a mapper gives the host a fake
  gateway (`HostThread::start_forwarded`, `wiring::start_host_with`). The
  battery, `quick_check.py` and `agent-run.sh` also set
  `TORE_NO_PORT_MAPPING=1`, which turns the real choice off for a run of the
  built binaries, `tore-app --map-port` included (it prints that it is
  turned off).
- **`--map-port SECONDS [--port N]`.** Asks as a hosting game does, prints the
  result, holds the mapping for that long and removes it; it exits with an
  error when the router did not forward the port. It is John's manual check
  of his router (slice IJ7).

### The connection path, shown and reported

Every player's game knows how it reached the host
([path codes](formats/net-protocol.md#the-path-in-the-challenge-answer)):
local network, by address, mapped port, IPv6, punched, relay.

- **Shown:** the join's last line in Messages names it; the lobby's player
  list draws a small mark beside the platform mark for a relayed player and
  shows the path in the selected player's line (stage J's last slice, with
  the lobby state's next protocol version); the net diagnostics log gains a
  `path` line (*built, J5*). *Built (J6, protocol 12):* the mark and the line,
  as the row says. *Agent decisions (J6):* only the relay has a mark (every
  other path is a direct one and the list stays quiet); the line reads
  "Viper connected through the relay." and so on, "Maverick's game runs this
  game." for the house, whose connection is the game's own, and an unable
  player's reason comes first (*changed, L4:* the line now starts with the
  player's Fighters Anthology build and system, "Viper: Fighters Anthology
  1.0, on macOS. Connected through the relay.", and "Runs this game." for the
  house; *changed again, L5:* the build is gone, "Viper: on macOS. Connected
  through the relay."); the line replaces the lobby's hint while a
  player is selected, as an unable player's reason did already; the new
  column sits between the platform's mark and the name, so the name and state
  columns are 2 pixels narrower.
- **Reported:** in the player's telemetry report, and the host's report
  counts its players by path. `tore-server`'s per-player log lines name it
  (*built, J6:* "127.0.0.1:5000 joined as Viper (path: relay)").
- **Used:** stage K's host selection never calculates a relayed host, and
  scores how open each candidate's router is from its mapping type and
  mapped port.

### Telemetry

What is sent, when, and the switch are in the guide's
[replay and telemetry](MULTIPLAYER.md#replay-and-telemetry); the bytes are
the master's [Report](formats/master-protocol.md#reports). The code:

- **The install id.** A random 64-bit number the game draws the first time it
  sends anything with telemetry on, kept in `network-v1.conf` as
  `install-id`. Turning telemetry off deletes it; turning it on again draws a
  new one, so the old and new cannot be linked. A dedicated server keeps its
  own in its data folder.
- **What sends.** Only games that use the master: a game hosting or joining
  through the Internet Lobby, and a listed dedicated server. Direct
  Connection never contacts the master.
- **The game:** `net/telemetry.rs` builds the player's or host's report from
  the session (length, most humans, path, time to connect, mapping results,
  relayed bytes) and sends it on the session's socket as it closes.
- **The master** turns reports into daily counts and never stores an
  address with them ([operations](MASTER-SERVER.md#what-the-master-keeps)).

### The NAT simulator

`tore_net::sim` gains routers (`sim/nat.rs`), so every path above is tested
in-process, deterministically, on the virtual clock. **Built (J1).**

- `SimNetwork::add_router(RouterConfig) -> RouterId`: the router's outside
  address, the inside addresses (a `Prefix`), how it maps (`Mapping`: one
  outside port for every destination; one per destination address; one per
  destination address and port), how it filters (`Filtering`: anyone; only
  addresses it has sent to; only addresses and ports it has sent to), how it
  picks outside ports (`PortChoice`: keep the inside port when free, the next
  free one, or seeded random), how long an idle mapping lasts (refreshed by
  outgoing traffic only), whether it loops back a datagram for its own
  outside address (hairpinning), and static forwards (a mapped or
  hand-forwarded port). The names are RFC 4787's.
- A router's outside address may be inside another router: a home router
  behind a carrier's (CGNAT) or behind a second home router.
- An IPv6 firewall is a router that translates nothing and filters by what
  was sent out (`RouterConfig::firewall`, an outside address of `None`).
- Each datagram is translated on its way out and on its way in, and the
  link's latency and loss apply as before; drops are counted per router and
  cause (`SimNetwork::router_stats`: no mapping, filtered, expired, and no
  hairpinning).
- Every existing use of the simulator, with no router added, behaves exactly
  as before: a test pins the received datagrams, the trace and the link
  counts of a lossy, reordering, duplicating run to the values the code
  before J1 gave.

What the build settled (each an agent decision):

- **When a router decides.** The routers on the sender's side translate a
  datagram as it is sent; the routers on the receiver's side check their
  mappings and filters when it arrives, with the state they have at that
  moment. So two ends punching toward each other at the same moment both
  get through, as on real routers, and a punch that arrives before the other
  end has sent is dropped. The network takes arrivals in through routers
  lazily, before anything sends or reads, each at its own arrival time.
  Routers on one path add no delay of their own; the link between the two
  sockets carries the whole latency.
- **Links across routers** are still keyed by the sending socket's own
  address and the address it sent to (for a datagram to a router, its
  outside address), so `set_default_link` covers every path and
  `set_link` can still single one out.
- **Where a socket or router stands.** `bind` places an address behind the
  router whose inside prefix holds it most narrowly, else on the open
  network. Two homes on the same `192.168.1.0/24` behind one carrier are
  told apart with `RouterConfig::behind` and `SimNetwork::bind_behind`.
  Sockets on one side of a router reach each other without it. Routers are
  added before the sockets behind them; a router that would take in an
  address already bound, an outside address another router or a socket has,
  or a forward to an address outside it is refused.
- **Mappings and ports.** Outside ports are 1,024 and up; a mapping's port is
  never shared, nor a forwarded one handed out. Keeping the inside port
  falls back to the next free one above it. Random ports come from a
  generator seeded by the network's seed and the router's number, so they
  change nothing else a seed decides.
- **Forwards** let anyone in, never expire, and carry the inside socket's own
  traffic out from the forwarded port, as routers with a port mapping do. A
  firewall's forward opens the inside address itself.
- **Hairpinning** loops a datagram back from the sender's outside address,
  through the filter like any other arrival; it is on by default, as RFC
  4787 asks. `RouterConfig::nat` is a typical home router: one outside port
  per socket, the inside port kept, filtering by address and port, two
  minutes idle.
- **Dual-stack sockets.** `SimNetwork::bind_dual(v4, v6)` is one socket at an
  IPv4 and an IPv6 address, as the joining player's dual-stack socket is: it
  sends from the address of the destination's family and receives at both,
  so a race can try both families from one socket.
- **What tests read.** Each trace entry gains `sent_as`, the source after the
  sender's routers (`None` when one dropped it), and
  `SimNetwork::mapped(router, inside, to)` gives a live mapping's outside
  address.

### Testing on one machine

Everything can be run on the development machine without the public master
([operations](MASTER-SERVER.md#testing-on-one-machine)):

- `tore-master --config` with `listen 127.0.0.1`, `port 26911` and
  `probe-port 26912` (other ports than the public ones, so a test never
  collides with a master John runs).
- The game with `--master 127.0.0.1:26911` (or the Options field), a
  `tore-server` with `broadcast on` and `master 127.0.0.1:26911`, and `tore-bot
  --master 127.0.0.1:26911 --listing NAME`.
- On one machine every direct path works, so the relay is tested with
  `--path relay`, and punching through routers only on the simulator.
- Port mapping is tested against a fake router on loopback (an SSDP
  responder and an HTTP device, a NAT-PMP and PCP responder), never the real
  router: mapping a port on John's router is his manual test.
- Rust tests cover the protocol, the master, the rendezvous and the race on
  the simulator; the net lane's `net-master-*` scenarios run the real
  binaries on loopback; the menus lane's `menus-snap-internet*` scenarios
  render the screen.

### How stages I and J land

Slices, each on its own `mp/<topic>` branch and worktree, merged by the lead
with the quick check per change and the check list at merge. "Opus" slices
are networking, concurrency or risky refactors, as John asked; the rest are
Sonnet. Each slice adds its tests to the full suite: Rust tests in the
crates it touches, and a battery scenario for anything done through a binary
(the net lane's `net-master-*`, the menus lane's `menus-snap-internet*`),
with slow tests ignored and named for the full run. Network scenarios are
drivers appended to `tools/battery_scenarios/net.py`, each in a family in
`tools/battery_selection.py`, and ignored Rust tests join the "Network tests
outside the battery" table in `docs/testing/README.md` (the net lane's
rules); slices that run at the same time each append there, which the lead
merges. No slice changes single
player; the quick single-player guard is enough for each, and none needs the
full baseline. The game's protocol version rises twice (J2 and J6), the
lead handing out the numbers; the master protocol starts at 1 and does not
change in these stages.

| Slice | Model | After | Owns | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 Master wire | Opus | | `tore-net/src/master/{mod,packet,candidate}.rs`, `tore-net/master-golden.txt`, one `pub mod master;` line in `tore-net/src/lib.rs` | Every packet of [master-protocol.md](formats/master-protocol.md): encode, bounded decode, padding, fitting answers to requests; addresses, candidates, mapping types; the summary coded as a discovery answer without its nonce; the constants (ports, version, the default master address as a placeholder until John names it); `CookieKey` made public for the master | Seeded round trips of every kind; 100,000 fuzzed datagrams never panic; the golden file; for every request an unproven sender may make, the largest possible answer is no longer than the request; a summary with every text at its limit and 30 callsigns fits Register, Heartbeat and Listing details, cut and flagged. **Built (I1, 2026-10-05):** `tore_net::master` with `packet.rs` (`MasterPacket`, the 26 kinds, `fit` on Register, Heartbeat, Listing details and Page, `RelayFrame` read in place), `candidate.rs` (addresses, candidates, `MappingType::from_probes`, `relay_likely`) and `mod.rs` (the constants, `DEFAULT_MASTER` as the placeholder `master.invalid:26901`, and `CookieKey`, a wrapper of the transport's cookie hash rather than the transport's type made public, so `entropy.rs` is unchanged); decoding is strict, so every packet has one encoding, and the 100,000-datagram fuzz checks that whatever decodes encodes back to the same bytes; what the build settled is in [the wire as built](formats/master-protocol.md#the-wire-as-built) |
| J1 NAT simulator | Opus | | `tore-net/src/sim.rs` moved to `sim/mod.rs`, new `sim/nat.rs` | [The NAT simulator](#the-nat-simulator) | One test per mapping, filtering and port-choice behaviour; mapping expiry refreshed by outgoing traffic only; hairpinning on and off; a router behind a router; an IPv6 firewall; static forwards; the same seed gives the same trace; every existing test that uses the simulator passes unchanged **Built (J1, 2026-10-05):** the routers as [designed](#the-nat-simulator), deciding arrivals when they arrive; 24 tests in `sim/nat.rs` cover each behaviour named here, a router deciding at arrival, two homes on one prefix behind a carrier, a dual-stack socket, links across routers and refused placements; a pinned fingerprint shows a run with no router gives exactly what the code before J1 gave, and every existing test passes unchanged |
| J4 Port mapping library | Opus | | `tore-net/src/portmap/{mod,ssdp,http,xml,igd,natpmp,pcp,gateway}.rs`, one `pub mod portmap;` line in `tore-net/src/lib.rs` | [Port mapping](#port-mapping): the three protocols at once, the gateway, renewing, removing, the second-router check | Against fakes on loopback: SSDP and the device description (both IGD versions, chunked bodies), `AddPortMapping`, the conflict code and the next port, a device that takes only a lease of 0, `DeletePortMapping`; NAT-PMP and PCP answers, PCP's version refusal falling back to NAT-PMP, nonces checked; a private outside address reported as a second router; every call ends within its time with a silent fake; the HTTP, XML and packet parsers fuzzed. **Built (J4, 2026-10-05):** 52 tests in `portmap`, about 6 seconds: every acceptance item, plus a `WANPPPConnection`, a device that needs equal ports after a conflict, refusals by each protocol, both gateways at once leaving one mapping, a failed renewal mapping again, a search answer naming another host not followed, and PCP for IPv6 on `::1`; the silent fakes end at 5.0 s for `map`, inside the budget for `renew` and `remove`. The fakes are public (`portmap::fake`) for J4b. The gateway is the system's default route first ([corrected](#port-mapping)) |
| I2 Master server | Opus | I1 | The new crate `crates/tore-master/` (every file), `tore-net/src/master/browse.rs`, the workspace `Cargo.toml` member and `Cargo.lock`, a `crates/tore-master/*` rule in `tools/battery_selection.py`, `docs/MASTER-SERVER.md` | [The master](#the-master): proving addresses, listings, heartbeats, keeps, expiry, Unknown listing, unregister, browse pages and details, probes on both ports, reports into daily counts, limits, the status line and daily table, the configuration and `--check-config`, the `flood` tool; the browse client. `introduce.rs` and `relay.rs` exist with their dispatch and drop their packets, counted, until J2 and J3 | On the simulator with a scripted host and browser: no listing without a cookie, and a forged source gets nothing but a 23-byte Challenge; a listing appears in the next Browse; a missing heartbeat drops it at 90 seconds (virtual clock), an Unregister at once; pages list every match once, filtered by build and fullness, in order; under a seeded flood from 1,000 sources the bytes answered to every unproven source are at most the bytes it sent, every limit holds, and a proper browser is still answered; IPv6 sources count by /64. Real sockets on 127.0.0.1: register and browse. Battery: `net-master-flood` (the master and its flood tool for 10 s; the status line shows the limits held and a browse during the flood answered). **Built (I2, 2026-10-05):** the crate as [the master](#the-master) describes, with the decisions listed there; 15 tests on the simulator in `master_tests.rs` (among them the forged Register, the exact 90-second expiry, pages under four filter sets, IPv6 by /64, probes behind an open and a symmetric router, and 1,000 flooding sources with the answer rate set to 1,000 so the total cap binds too), unit tests in each module, a real-socket test in `tests/loopback.rs`, the `Browser` client with its own tests, and `net-master-flood` in the net lane. The master logs `listed`, `moved` and `unlisted` lines ([formats](MASTER-SERVER.md#logs-and-statistics)) |
| I3 Listing from hosts | Opus | I1; its end-to-end commit after I2 | `tore-net/src/master/{rendezvous,routed,local}.rs`, `meet.rs` and `relay.rs` as dispatch stubs, `crates/tore-server/src/{config,wiring,run,console,options}.rs` and its tests, `docs/DEDICATED-SERVER.md`, `crates/tore-app/src/net/{hosting,hosting_tests,options}.rs` | The host's `Rendezvous` and `Routed` ([one socket](#one-socket-two-protocols), [listing](#listing-a-game)): lookup, mapping test, register, heartbeats with the summary, change heartbeats, keeps, register again, back-off, unregister; the install id in Register; the host's or server's Report at the session's end. `tore-server`: `broadcast` (off by default; John named it, the design said `list`), `master`, `telemetry`, the console's `broadcast on` and `broadcast off`, the start and status lines. The game: `HostSetup.listing`, `Command::SetListed`, `Report::Listing`, `--host FILE --list [--master ADDRESS]` | On the simulator against `tore_master::Master` (a dev-dependency): a host is browsable within its first exchange and its summary's changes within 5 seconds; a vanished host is gone within 90 seconds; a master restart is healed within one heartbeat; a silent master is asked with back-off, never more than once a second; game datagrams pass `Routed` unchanged and no master datagram reaches the transport; a claim of `100::/64` from the socket is dropped. A hosting thread with `listing` registers to an in-test master and unregisters on stop. Battery: `net-master-listing` (a master, a `tore-server` with `broadcast on`, `tore-app --browse 5` lists it; quitting the server removes it). **Built (I3, 2026-10-05):** `tore_net::master::{rendezvous,routed,local}` with `HostListing` tying the state machine to the master's lookup on a thread (again every 10 minutes and after a silence) and the host's own addresses; `tore-server`'s `broadcast`, `master`, `telemetry`, the console's `broadcast on` and `broadcast off`, a `Broadcast:` start line and the listing at the end of the status line; the game's `HostThread::start_listed` with a `Listing` beside the `HostSetup` (so the tests' hosts stay unchanged), `Command::SetListed`, `Report::Listing(ListingState)` and `--host FILE --list [--master ADDRESS]`. Agent decisions: the probes and the Register go out together (the listing does not wait for the mapping test); an unanswered request is repeated every 3 seconds until the master is silent, then after 2 to 60 seconds, the master's next address each time; no two Heartbeats or Keeps closer than 2 seconds, and no Keep when a Heartbeat is due within that; a change Heartbeat goes when the summary changes, at most one every 5 seconds, the summary looked at once a second; three Unregisters at once; the master's second port is the main port plus one; a stage I host counts its players' paths as local network or by address from their addresses; a server keeps its install id in `server-install-id` in its data folder, drawn at start while telemetry is on; `--host --list` sends no install id and no Report until I4's notice and switch. Tested on the simulator against a scripted master in `tore-net`, and end to end against the real `tore_master::Master` (a dev-dependency of `tore-server`, `listing_test.rs`: on the simulator with the Internet Lobby's own `Browser`, and a real server on 127.0.0.1); the hosting thread's test uses a small loopback master. `net-master-listing` judges the listing from `tore-master`'s own output until I4 adds `tore-app --browse 5` to it (the lead's call) |
| I4 Internet Lobby screen | Sonnet | I2; New after I3 | `crates/tore-app/src/internet_screen/*`, `net/{browse,telemetry,settings}.rs`, `menu.rs`, `main.rs` (routing, `--browse`, snapshot states), `widgets/header.rs`, `assets/internet-lobby-title.png`, the `internet_screen/*` rule in `tools/battery_selection.py`, the menus lane's `menus-snap-internet*` scenarios, `README.md`'s telemetry section | [The screen](#the-internet-lobby-screen); Join straight to the seen address; New hosting a listed game; Options (the master's address, port forwarding and statistics switches, kept in `network-v1.conf`); the install id; the player's Report | Screen tests (paging, filters, sorting, selection, keys, the shared callsign and port); headless renders of the five snapshot states; `--browse` against a scripted master; a windowed run through `tools/agent-run.sh`: open the Internet Lobby with a loopback master and a listed `tore-server`, join, fly 30 seconds, leave, and New lists a hosted game that a second `--browse` sees **Built (I4, 2026-10-05):** as [the screen](#the-internet-lobby-screen) describes, with its decisions; Join works through the master's introduction; `net-window-internet` runs the windowed part |
| J2 Introductions and punching | Opus | I2, I3, J1 | `crates/tore-master/src/introduce.rs`, `tore-net/src/master/{meet,join}.rs`, `tore-net/src/{client,server,packet}.rs`, `tore-session/src/client/` (joining through candidates), `tore-session/src/{bot.rs,bin/tore-bot.rs}`, the protocol version and `wire-golden.txt` | [Joining through the master](#joining-through-the-master) up to the race, and [hole punching](#hole-punching): Introduce with its cookie, Introduction and Meet with retries and hints on the master; Meet, punches and the ack on the host; the player's rendezvous; `Client::connect_any` with candidates learned from punches; the path byte in the Challenge answer and `ConnectDetails::path`; `tore-bot --master --listing --path`. The next protocol version | On the simulator, every row of the [punching table](#hole-punching) gives its expected path, at a 100 ms round trip within 1.5 seconds where it punches; a forged Introduce gets only a Challenge; a host sends at most five punches per address per Meet and acts on at most 10 Meets a second; a Punch with another id is only counted; the wire golden file. Battery: `net-master-introduce` (a master, a listed `tore-server`, `tore-bot --listing` joins through an introduction and flies 30 seconds). **Built (J2, 2026-10-05):** protocol 9 (the Punch, kind 11, and the path byte after the platform byte; `ConnectDetails::path`, the relay for a relayed address); `Client::connect_any` with `Target`s and up to four addresses learned from punches; the master's introductions ([as built](formats/master-protocol.md#introductions-as-built)); a host's `meet.rs`, which its rendezvous drives, sending the punches and the Meet ack itself (a hook in `rendezvous.rs`, outside the row's files, the lead's stub for it); a player's `join.rs` (`Joiner`, its own socket router); the session client's `ClientConfig::race` and the capture's Race record; `tore-bot --master --listing --path auto\|direct`, `--path relay` refused until J3. Tests: the punching table in `crates/tore-master/tests/punch.rs` (12 tests, every row, 320 to 550 ms where it punches), `introduce_tests.rs` in `tore-master` (the forged Introduce, results, retries, the hint, limits), `meet.rs`'s and `join_tests.rs`'s unit tests, the transport client's race and the server's path, a raced session join whose capture replays, and `net-master-introduce` in the net lane. A seen address that is the host's own Mapped or Global IPv6 candidate reads as that path (agent decision). The master's `I2` stub test and flood allowance now expect the Introduce's 23-byte Challenge |
| J3 Relay | Opus | J2 | `crates/tore-master/src/relay.rs`, `tore-net/src/master/relay.rs`, `tore-net/src/master/routed.rs` (relayed addresses), `tore-net/src/socket.rs` (`try_clone`), the bot's `--path relay` | [The relay](#the-relay): channels, keys, the host's ack, rates, idle, the allowance and its file, closing; relayed addresses; the framing wrapper for the keepalive thread | On the simulator: the two relay rows of the punching table connect through the relay; a host with two relayed bots and one direct flies 60 seconds with the stage D matrix's limits for the direct and relayed bots alike (the relay adds only its delay); a frame from a third address or with a wrong key is dropped; a channel flooded at 200 KB/s passes 64 KB/s; idle channels close at 30 seconds; a spent allowance refuses new channels with its text and survives a master restart; a relayed bot stalled 15 seconds stays connected through its framed keepalives. Battery: `net-master-relay` (`tore-bot --path relay` against a listed `tore-server` through a loopback master, 30 seconds, no drop, the master's status counts the bytes). **Built (J3, 2026-10-05):** as [the relay](#the-relay) describes, with its decisions there. Beyond the row's files: the player's side in `join.rs` (`ask_relay`, the offer, `close_relay`, `keepalive_socket`, new `JoinEvent`s) and the host's in `rendezvous.rs` (the ack, the close, `relayed`, `close_relayed`), the master's dispatch in `master.rs`, `Introductions::ends`, the run loop's month file, `--check-config` and start lines that say plainly whether the relay is active, `relay opened`, `relay closed` and allowance log lines, and the status line's `relayed`, `channels` and `relay-month`. Tests: every relay row of the punching table connects through the relay (`tests/punch.rs`); `relay_tests.rs` in `tore-master` (a channel both ways with the longest datagram, a third address and a wrong key, a request checked against its introduction, 200 KB/s passing 64 and the channel closed after 30 seconds over its rate, idle at 30 seconds, the refusals, two per source, a silent host, the allowance at 95 and 100 percent, a stopping master, and the month's figure read back by a restarted `Running`); `relay_tests.rs` in `tore-session`'s client (two relayed bots and one direct under the matrix's limits in its 150 ms, 2 percent cell, about 25 seconds; a relayed bot stalled 15 seconds kept by keepalives framed for its channel); unit tests of the channels, the host's acks, the wrapper, the joiner's requests and `ServerSocket::try_clone`; and `net-master-relay` in the net lane. `tore-session` gains `tore-master` as a dev-dependency; the matrix's `run` became `fly`, for any bots and any step |
| J4b Port mapping in hosts | Sonnet | J4, I3, I4 | `crates/tore-app/src/net/{hosting,options}.rs`, `direct_screen/options.rs`, `internet_screen/options.rs`, `crates/tore-server/src/{config,wiring}.rs`, `docs/DEDICATED-SERVER.md` | A hosting game's mapper thread, its messages and the Mapped candidate; the switch in both Options panels; `tore-server`'s `port-mapping`; `tore-app --map-port` | Against the loopback fakes: hosting maps the port, shows the address, gives the rendezvous the Mapped candidate and removes the mapping when hosting stops; the switch off maps nothing; a second router is reported. No battery scenario (a real one would change John's router); the manual test is in IJ7. **Built (J4b, 2026-10-05):** [the hosts' mapper thread, the Mapped candidate, the lobby's lines and the switch](#port-mapping-in-the-hosts-as-built-j4b); `tore_net::portmap::keeper` (the thread, shared by the game and the server), `Rendezvous::set_mapped` and `HostListing::set_mapped` in `tore-net`, `HostThread::start_forwarded` and `Report::Forward` in the game, `port-mapping` in `tore-server`, the switch in Direct Connection's Options (the Internet Lobby's was there), and `tore-app --map-port SECONDS [--port N]`. Files beyond the row, with the lead's approval: `portmap/keeper.rs` and its one `mod` line, `master/rendezvous.rs` (and its tests), `lobby_screen/app.rs` (the lobby drains the host thread's lines into Messages), `main.rs` (the `--map-port` arm and help), `direct_screen/{mod,tests}.rs`, `tools/{battery,quick_check}.py` and `tools/agent-run.sh` (`TORE_NO_PORT_MAPPING=1`). Tests: 7 in `portmap::keeper` (map, tell the address, remove on finish for PCP and UPnP; a silent router reported plainly and asked again; a second router; a renewal that changes nothing is no news; finish within its limit with a router silent at the end), 4 in `master::rendezvous` (the Mapped candidate in Register and Heartbeats, a change reaching the master within 5 seconds, surviving new own candidates and the mapping test, a host listing after its lookup), 2 hosting-thread tests (maps, lists the Mapped candidate through a loopback master and removes the mapping before the thread ends; a refusing router is told and the host runs on) and the switch-off case, 1 server test (maps at start, logs, removes at quit), `--map-port` against fakes, the Direct Options switch by key, mouse and Cancel, and the tests that a test build never chooses the real router. All against fakes on loopback; none reaches a real router. Agent decisions: the keeper lives in `tore-net` so the server shares it; the `TORE_NO_PORT_MAPPING` veto; failure words end with "Friends outside your network may need the relay."; a failure is asked again after 10 minutes; the removal starts when the stop is asked for and the host waits at most 2.5 seconds for it |
| J5 Joining through the master in the game | Opus | J2, I4; its relay commit after J3 | `crates/tore-app/src/net/{session,play}.rs`, `internet_screen/{mod,app}.rs`, a new `net/join_tests.rs` | `Transport::Internet`; Join on a listing runs the mapping test, the introduction, the race and the relay; the Messages lines; the framed keepalive for a relayed session; the path in the net log and the player's report | In-process: a hosting thread with a rendezvous, a master core and a game session joined by listing, once direct and once with `--path relay`, each seated and flying; the Messages lines in order; a refused introduction is a plain line. A windowed run joins a listed `tore-server` through a loopback master with the relay forced **Built (J5, 2026-10-05):** as [joining through the master](#joining-through-the-master) describes, with its decisions there: `MasterTransport` and `NetSession::pump`'s turn for the race, the relay (a new client on the relayed address), the 15-second give-up and the closed channel; the session's notices for each step; `TORE_JOIN_PATH` for the relay only; the framed keepalive; a `path` line in the net log; the player's Report with the path, mapping type, relayed kilobytes and time to the handshake. Beyond the row's files: two test helpers on the screen, `tools/battery_scenarios/net.py` and `tools/battery_selection.py`. Tests: `net/join_tests.rs` (8 tests, about 14 seconds: direct and relayed joins seated and flying, the lines in order, a stall held through the relay, a refused relay, a refused introduction, the rules) and the windowed `net-window-internet-relay` |
| J6 Path in the lobby | Sonnet | J5, J3 | `tore-session/src/wire/messages.rs` and `host/lobby.rs` (the player's path in 3 bits), `wire-golden.txt`, `crates/tore-app/src/lobby_screen/*`, `widgets/icons.rs` (the relay mark), `tore-server`'s per-player log lines | [Shown and reported](#the-connection-path-shown-and-reported); the next protocol version | Lobby state round trip with every path; the lobby screen's snapshot with a relayed player; the wire golden file **Built (J6, 2026-10-05):** protocol 12 puts each player's path in the lobby state, 3 bits after its platform ([bytes](formats/net-protocol.md#the-path-in-the-challenge-answer)); the host keeps it in its `Peer` from the join details and sends it with every lobby state (and in `HostLog::Connected`); `tore-server`'s join line ends "(path: relay)"; the Players list's new column carries a relay mark (a new `relay.svg` in the icon atlas) for a relayed player, the selected player's line says how it connected, and a slot whose player is away reads "AI (Viper away)" (F2-A's mark, drawn here). Beyond the row's files: `host/mod.rs` (the lobby state is built there; `host/lobby.rs` needed no change), `wire/mod.rs` (the version and `path_words`), `wire/samples.rs` and the wire round-trip tests, `tore-server`'s `host.rs`, `wiring.rs` and `run.rs`, `ui-text.bin` regenerated by `tools/build_ui_text_atlas.py` with the glyphs byte for byte as before, the lobby preview's two snapshot states and the menus lane's state list. Tests: `host::tests::path_tests` (four players by four paths, each hears every other's, and the host's log), `wire::round_trip_tests` (every path, codes 6 and 7 invalid), the golden at version 12, `lobby_screen::tests` (the mark in the row beside the platform's, every path's words, the drawn mark, the away slot) and the icon tests; `menus-snap-lobby-relay` and `menus-snap-lobby-away` in the menus lane |
| IJ7 Deployment and acceptance | lead, then John | all | `docs/baselines/master-<date>.md`, the default master address | John sets up the master as [the operations guide](MASTER-SERVER.md#deploying-at-jrovertoncom) says; the lead sets the default address and smoke-tests on this machine (a loopback master, a listed hosting game, a bot joining direct and relayed); then John's tests on real networks. **Partly built (IJ7, 2026-10-05):** John deployed the master at `master.jroverton.com` (UDP 26901 and 26902, an A record and then an AAAA record) and the game's default master is that address (913e7cfd); the lead's flood check from outside held (19,998 datagrams in 10 seconds, 296 answered, no port answered with more bytes than it sent, "limits held"); the record is [the deployment baseline](baselines/master-2026-10-05.md). `.github/workflows/release.yml` now also builds a Linux `tore-master` on the game's Ubuntu 22.04 runner (glibc floor 2.35, checked), packs it with its checksum as `tore-master-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and publishes it beside the game's packages as its own artifact (`master-ubuntu-22.04`); [the operations guide](MASTER-SERVER.md#downloading-a-release) says how to use it. The steps were run by hand against a local build, but the workflow has not run, and the existing appimagetool pin (see `tools/package/package-linux.sh`) is untouched. **Waits for John:** a game listed and seen from another network, a join through the introduction from another network, a relayed join from a phone hotspot, a join over IPv6, and `tore-app --map-port 30` on his router, all listed in the baseline | The plan's acceptance for I and J: a session hosted on one machine appears in another's browser within one heartbeat and is gone within 90 seconds of its host vanishing; the flood test holds; connections succeed on a home router, through double NAT, over a phone hotspot (CGNAT) through the relay, and directly over IPv6 |

What can run at the same time (their files are disjoint):

1. **I1, J1 and J4** start together. Each adds one `pub mod` line to
   `tore-net/src/lib.rs` at its alphabetical place; J1 adds none (the `sim`
   module keeps its name).
2. **I2 and I3** once I1 is in. I3 builds against a scripted master in its
   tests and rebases on I2 for its last commit, the end-to-end tests against
   the real `Master`.
3. **I4 and J2** once I2 (and, for J2, I3 and J1) are in: I4 is the game's
   screens, J2 the transport, the master and the session.
4. **J3 and J4b** together: J3 is `tore-master` and `tore-net`, J4b the
   game's hosting and `tore-server`.
5. **J5**, then **J6**, then **IJ7**.

Other stages' slices touch some of the same files, which the lead
sequences: J6 and stage F phase 2 both change the lobby's wire and the lobby
screen; J5 and stage E's capture conversion both touch `net/session.rs`;
J2, J6 and any other slice that raises the protocol version need their
numbers handed out in merge order.

## Performance and threads

Implementation mode, on `performance`. John authorized plan revisions and
implementation with subagents on 2026-10-03. The lead reviewed their changes.
Implementation choices below are agent decisions. The [feature baseline](baselines/performance-threads.md)
records measurements and validation status; the [testing guide](testing/performance.md)
explains how to repeat them. Linux validation is complete. Platform and manual
review limits are recorded in the baseline.

The starting gameplay revision is `c1d1e736`, which includes PF1's exact firing
estimate shortcuts. PF0's earlier profile and code surveys are retained under
`.local/mp-notes/perf/`. They identified expensive observation, CPU aircraft
geometry, instrument preparation and per-seat host work. They are historical
candidate measurements, not the before reference for this implementation.

### What stays fixed

- Results remain bit for bit identical for the same inputs on the same platform.
  Goldens, recordings, combat tapes and the canonical single-player baseline
  remain unchanged. Render captures compare on the same GPU backend and settings.
- The AI retains its current actor iteration and same-tick decision visibility
  (John, 2026-10-02). Workers never make decisions from live peer state.
- The [frame loop under load](#the-frame-loop-under-load) keeps every tick a
  frame owes. There is no new tick cap (John, 2026-10-02), and simulation remains
  fixed at 120 Hz independently of rendering.
- All flight adapters retain their existing defaults and compatibility paths.
- Rayon is the approved new external dependency (John, 2026-10-02). Only the
  internal `tore-workers` crate names it. Project code retains its existing
  unsafe-code boundary; the native scheduling call stays in `tore-realtime-native`.
- GPU transforms, different culling, fewer shadow passes and other changes to
  pixels remain outside this work. No original executable is used.

### Shared scoped workers

One `tore-workers::Executor` is shared by the process, including a hosting game
and its frame loop. The fitted automatic size is available logical CPUs minus
three, capped at eight. If that leaves fewer than two workers, automatic
execution is serial. This leaves scheduling headroom, not reserved cores.
`TORE_WORKERS=0` runs inline; explicit sizes, including one, are capped at eight.
Invalid settings or thread-creation failure produce a diagnostic and retain
serial execution. Successful initialization is silent.

The interface provides ordered borrowed maps and disjoint mutable visits.
The unused mutable-map and join APIs were removed after review. Instrument
pages run as independent collection items; they do not overlap scene building.
No Rayon types cross the interface. Every scoped job finishes before its inputs
can change or a panic propagates. CPU jobs must not block waiting on each other.
Window operations and ordered GPU submission remain on the calling thread.

Tests construct explicit serial, parallel or repeatably shuffled executors;
they never mutate process environment to switch modes. Ordered results are
published by input index, not completion order. Tests exercise borrowed outputs,
mutable disjoint work, simultaneous callers, panic completion and nested work
with one worker. Thresholds are measured on this implementation, not inferred
from PF0's different `std` pool.

macOS workers request user-interactive QoS at startup through the existing
native boundary. This does not pin a core, guarantee a deadline or give workers
the host's real-time policy. Failures remain diagnostic. Terrain query entry
points that cross threads require `Sync`; sensor environments are constructed
within each job and need no shared lock.

### AI observation and ordered decisions

The implementation uses a narrower boundary than PF0's proposed full look
phase. Workers receive an actor-local context and borrowed sensor/memory inputs,
never `AiMission` or live peer actors. Each prepares owned observation state.
The normal actor loop still performs leader/runway reads, damage, ejection,
defense, decisions and flight in their original order. It applies the prepared
state exactly where the old observation call stood. No published-peer table is
needed.

New damage recovery observes inline because its preamble clears selection.
Dummy, destroyed and escaping actors are excluded. A later early return or
error discards unapplied results, leaving later actors unchanged. Serial
execution and fewer than four eligible actors retain the original in-place
observation path without speculative clones.

Prepared target visibility is a separate boolean vector, consumed at the
original decision-frame target loop. The pre-flight position and terrain
provider match those used by that loop; awareness memory keeps its original
metadata. Nothing is shared across actors or ticks, and visual rejection
reasons retain their original priority. Job-wide visibility caches were
measured and rejected because their lookup cost regressed smaller worker
configurations. The dispatch floor is a fitted performance choice, not a
gameplay constant.

Sensor channels share one actor-local visibility answer only when the ordered
endpoint bits match. A query with different endpoints calls the terrain service
again without replacing the first entry. This keeps repeated channel checks
cheap without making future callers depend on an implicit endpoint assumption.

A test-only copy of the unsplit observation code independently validates the
serial extraction. Worker comparisons cover complete actor/mission state,
flight bytes, outputs and bounded journal contents, including new damage
recovery, shared airports, cancelled landings, ejection, late leaders, human
handoff and error partial state.

### Ownships and host pictures

In combat, each active ownship's sensors, selection, emitters, mounted seeker,
weapon observation and firing estimate read fixed target rows and modify only
that ownship. Two or more active ownships can use workers. Inactive ownships
are untouched. Readiness, projectile capacity, ammunition, firing, IDs, random
streams and event publication retain the existing serial order.

The host prepares immutable pictures and readouts for the connections whose
snapshots are due. It preserves the staggered seat schedule and connection-ID
iteration order. Name registration, packet budgets, staging, sends and
sent/discard/acknowledgement bookkeeping remain serial. Missing planes/cockpits
keep their original skip behavior. Tests compare exact packet bytes and order
through failures, seat changes and reconnects, as well as world state.

### Frame preparation

Aircraft vertices are built per aircraft or debris piece, then concatenated
in the original model, target and debris order. Contact ranges use final batch
offsets. Fewer than four visible jobs use the original serial builder. This
also serves camera-panel views, including many aircraft sharing one model.

Static airport triangles and lines share one immutable cached batch keyed by
the standing placement set. Each renderer uploads only when the batch identity
changes. Scenery rebuilds, renderer replacement, destruction, reset and replay
seeking retain their normal lifecycle. Camera origin and palette changes do
not invalidate these world-space source vertices. The redundant late-frame
flight upload is removed; the pre-preview upload remains in place.

Instrument work includes page rasterisation and dirty-page scaling. Each
distinct page is one job; repeated occurrences of that page prepare in slot
order within the job, preserving final cache state even when sizes differ.
Immutable `Arc` cache entries avoid copying warm images. At least two distinct
pages can use workers. Jobs join at the existing `FlightCanvas::begin` call
point, after previews, readout, palette and hover state are fixed. Clearing,
composition and cache publication remain on the caller in original slot order.
Unshown cache entries remain available.

Already-sized images with transparent corners have an exact integer-coordinate
composition path. The original filter remains for scaling, fractional placement
and clipping. Independent pixel tests cover every source/destination alpha pair.
The tick presenter reuses an identical camera scene instead of rebuilding it
between unchanged simulation inputs. GPU and window work never moves to workers.

### Measurement rules

Before and after use the same release compiler, profile content, workload,
resolution and rendering settings. Raw output stays in `.local/`; measured
results have one home in the [feature baseline](baselines/performance-threads.md).
Do not time concurrent builds or another game. Retain repeated spreads and
outliers. Shader/GPU timings are not inferred from CPU samples.

Flight and terrain captures hold the explicitly prepared state during window
and GPU initialization. Startup wall time previously advanced their simulation
or weather, even between runs of one unchanged binary. Both comparison builds
use the same capture-only hold, and repeated-capture battery cases guard it.

- Light and heavy flights run at 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x, audio on/off. Lock cases
  must show AIM120.JT designation and an estimate at the requested speed.
  Fixed simulation-tick workloads record final-frame overshoot. Include a
  sustained accelerated-flight pass, not just the expensive opening fight.
- Host cases use 0, 15 and 30 humans. Measure complete elapsed operations,
  including worker completion. Linux host-thread CPU time excludes workers
  and is a separate diagnostic, never the threading speed-up.
- Test worker counts 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8, idle/busy dispatch, small work and
  simultaneous callers. A real hosting game with rendering, camera panels
  and audio additionally checks shared-pool contention and overloads.
- Record achieved simulation rate, frame p50/p95/p99/max and host elapsed
  costs. Eight-times speed needs 960 ticks per wall second, leaving less
  than 1.042 ms per tick before drawing. Faster CPU work does not guarantee
  that every heavy opening fight reaches 8x.
- CPU-only synthetic probes are portable and require no retail media.
  Actual frames require a graphics host and imported media. Report unrun
  platforms explicitly; do not claim CI validation from a local Linux pass.

Audio on/off measurements and user-space sampling did not reproduce PF1's
severe audio-dependent slowdown. Audio behavior is unchanged. Sampling cannot
establish callback dropout counts or rule out a rare lock stall. If a
reproducible gap remains, measure lock waiting/holding and callback silence
before choosing a fix, preserving tick events and deterministic offline output.

### Preservation and acceptance

The independent before reference is recorded before simulation edits. Serial
extraction is validated before becoming the worker reference. Never update a
golden to make a threading change pass. Explicit 0/1/2/4/8-worker and shuffled
comparisons include floating-point bits, ordered output, full journal contents,
all ownships and affected actor state. The older whole-tick fingerprint covers
selected fields and journal counts; it is not the sole proof.

The canonical single-player harness, AI probe recordings, replays, combat tapes,
network matrix and existing goldens remain guards. Fixed-tick capture hashes,
vertex/contact lists and canvas/cache comparisons validate presentation. New
cache tests cover destruction/reset, replay seeking, duplicates and resize.
Full repository checks and the same before/after workloads finish the pass.
John reviews the resulting flight before a merge into `multiplayer`.

| PF7 Acceptance | Linux validated | all applicable slices | Repeated frozen tests and measurements; hosted-flight contention; full diff review | Required Linux checks, unchanged behavior, measured gains and documented platform/manual review limits |

PF2a was recorded first. Independent files were delegated with one owner for
manifests and one for shared frame-loop edits. The lead reviewed full diffs and
reran acceptance checks. Measurements use frozen binaries/checkouts so later
edits cannot change a reference run. Integration follows [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
and stays on `performance` for John's review before a merge.

A separate render thread, parallel GPU encoding, mission-load workers and
threaded projectiles are outside this pass. GPU-side work remains a separate
decision; no pixel-changing shortcut is implied by a CPU speed-up.

## Exact checkpoints

Design for stage H of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written on 2026-10-05 by a design agent for the lead. The format, coding
rules, coverage rule and scenarios are in the
[checkpoint format](formats/checkpoint.md); this section is how the code is
shaped and how the work is split. John's decision is that host migration is
exact (2026-09-28); every other choice is an agent decision. The slice table
below marks each slice that is built.

In short:

- `World::checkpoint()` writes every piece of mutable mission state between
  two ticks; `World::restore(bytes)` loads it over a fresh `World` built from
  the same mission, which then steps on bit for bit. Mission setup (terrain,
  aircraft types, phrases, the layout) comes from the fresh world; the
  structure that handoffs change (cockpits, ownships, AI actors, radio
  channels) comes from the bytes.
- One trait, `tore_sim::checkpoint::Checkpoint`, codes each type exactly, with
  every field named so a forgotten one fails to compile. It reuses
  `tore-codec`'s exact float coding and the wire's exact flight coder, and
  changes no byte of the wire.
- Each module's coders sit beside it in a `<module>_checkpoint.rs` child
  module, so the encoders read private fields without opening them up and
  without editing simulation code. That also lets several agents code
  different modules at the same time.
- An equivalence test restores scenarios mid-fight, mid-landing, on the ground
  and with handoffs into fresh worlds and steps both copies on, on every CI
  platform.

### What the surveys found

Six read-only surveys at `884f9916` walked every type reachable from `World`
(the summary by area is in the
[format](formats/checkpoint.md#the-state-by-area)). What shaped the design:

- **Deterministic already.** No `HashMap`, `Rc`, `RefCell`, stored closure or
  thread-local in mission state; every map is a `BTreeMap`; every random
  stream is seeded from the mission and holds one or two integers. Worker
  results are never stored between ticks. The one process switch that changes
  results is the retail stall speeds.
- **Private everywhere.** Almost every state type keeps its fields private, so
  coders must live in a child module of the type's own module.
- **Structure changes mid-flight.** Handoffs insert and remove AI actors,
  ownships, cockpits, AI slots, configurations and radio channels. A restore
  cannot assume the fresh world's lists.
- **Copies of imported records.** Ownship and AI configurations, weapon
  records on stations and on missiles, sensor profiles and runway views (up to
  four per AI actor) are copied into state. They never change, but they are
  not derivable from the setup alone after a handoff, so they are coded once
  each as shared records.
- **Not everything called a cache is one.** Several fields documented as
  caches or presentation are read back by a later tick; the
  [scratch rule](formats/checkpoint.md#what-it-holds-and-what-it-leaves-out)
  keeps them coded.
- **Write-only explanations are large.** The AI journal, traces, draw logs and
  the radio journal's causes would double the number of types for text no
  standby needs; they are the "why-records" the checkpoint leaves out.
- **`World::tick` is combat's tick.** There is no separate world counter.

### The pieces

| Piece | Where | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Checkpoint`, `InPlace` | `tore-sim/src/checkpoint.rs` | The traits: `save(&self, s, base)` and `load(l, base)`, or `save_in_place` and `restore_in_place(&mut self, l)` for holders that keep setup fields |
| `Saver`, `Loader` | same | A `BitWriter` with the shared-record table and the world's flight models; a `BitReader` with the shared records and the fresh world's flight models |
| `Models` | same; filled by `tore-world/src/checkpoint.rs` | Every distinct flight model the world holds, by aircraft identity and a canonical ordinal, as the import built it (`flight::State::import_model` undoes the weight scaling) |
| Macros | same, exported | `checkpoint_struct!` (with `shared { .. }` and `skip { field = rebuild }`), `checkpoint_enum!`, `checkpoint_tuple!`; `checkpoint_via_exact!` inside `tore-sim` |
| Standard impls | same | Integers, floats, `bool`, `String`, `()`, `Option`, `Box`, arrays, tuples, `Vec`, `VecDeque`, `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet`; the flight state's helpers (`save_flight`, `load_flight`); `to_bytes`, `from_bytes`, `round_trip` and `round_trip_in_place` for the slices' tests |
| Leaf types shared by slices | `tore-sim/src/checkpoint_shared.rs`, `tore-sim/src/ai/checkpoint.rs`, the end of `tore-world/src/checkpoint.rs` | `AircraftId`, `Side`, `Activity`, `SeekerClass`, `ResolvedExperience`, `ScalarSpeed`, `SpeedLimits`, `ApproachEnd`, airfield `Phase`, `LandingReason`, `LandingOrder`, `RunwayView`, `AirfieldAnchors`, `Basis`, `FuelState`, `StationId`, `Rounds`, `StoreState`, `StoreCapability`, `Formation`, `WingControl`, `DispenserStore`, `Emitter`, `TargetView`, `ThreatReport`, `FrameEvent`, the gunner's `Target`, missile `Rules`, `DecisionRandom`; `PlaneId`, `SeatId`, `Crew`; and, through their `Exact` coders, the random streams and clocks, turbulence, cheats, sensor controls, wrecks and escapes |
| The container | `tore-world/src/checkpoint.rs` | Header, section framing, shared-record table, CRC-32, mission identity; `World::checkpoint`, `World::restore`, `World::mission_identity`, `checkpoint::layout` (read and check a container without restoring it), and with `test-support` `World::checkpoint_sections` and `World::restore_sections` (the twin restore) |
| Section coders | each slice's `*_checkpoint.rs` | One function pair per section, called by the container |
| The harness | `tore-world/src/world/checkpoint_tests.rs`, `world/checkpoint_scenarios.rs` | Scenario builders, twin restore per section, the whole-world equivalence, round trips, damaged bytes |
| Measurement | `tore-session/tests/checkpoint_cost.rs` | Size by section, encode and restore time and catch-up on real data, ignored |

The new public surface is small: `World::checkpoint`, `World::restore`, the
error type, and the trait module (`tore_sim::checkpoint`) that `tore-world`
needs across the crate boundary. Coders are private child modules.

### Restoring, in order

`World::restore` checks the whole container first (magic, version, switches,
mission identity, CRC-32, section framing), then builds the flight model
table from the fresh world, decodes the shared records, and restores the
sections in id order. Each section's coder replaces its part of the world; a section never
reads another section's decoded values, only ids, so the order is a choice,
not a dependency. On an error the world is to be discarded.

### How stage H lands

Slices, each on its own `mp/h-<topic>` branch and worktree, merged by the
lead with the quick check per change. Every coding slice only adds files named
`*_checkpoint.rs` and fills the stubs H0 left for it; H0 adds every
`mod checkpoint` line the slices need, so no two slices edit the same file.
A coder never changes simulation code: if one needs a constructor or an
accessor, it lives in its own `*_checkpoint.rs` child module, which can see
the private fields. A slice that finds it must edit a simulation file stops
and asks the lead.

H0 codes every simple public type that more than one slice needs (the leaf
types above) and leaves a stub coder that returns `NotCovered` for every
other type that one slice codes and another slice's coder calls, and for each
section's root, so every slice compiles and tests on its own. The stubs are
`Weapon` and `live::Configuration` (`checkpoint_records.rs`), `Sensors`,
`SignatureProfile`, `JammerProfile` and `ThreatService` (H1); the roster,
cockpits and weather sections (H2); `live::State` (H3a); `Smoke`, `Devices`,
`Piece`, `Mark`, the blast `Rolls` and the combat section (H3b); `AiMission`
(H4); `Controller` (H5); the AI wings section and `Tracker` (H6); and the
comms and wing status sections, `AirfieldRadio` and `CrewVoice` (H7). A slice
that codes another module adds its own `*_checkpoint.rs` and the one `mod`
line in that module's file. A slice's acceptance is its own
round trips: values taken from stepped fixture worlds code to bytes, decode
to an equal value (by `PartialEq` where the type has it, otherwise by coding
again to the same bytes), and step on identically where the type can be
stepped alone. The **twin restore** of a whole section passes when every
slice under it has merged; the lead runs it at each merge.

| Slice | Model | After | Owns | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H0 Scaffolding | Opus | | `tore-sim/src/checkpoint.rs`, `checkpoint_shared.rs`, `checkpoint_tests.rs`, `tore-sim/src/ai/checkpoint.rs`, `tore-world/src/checkpoint.rs`, `radio_calls_checkpoint.rs`, `world/checkpoint_tests.rs`, `world/checkpoint_scenarios.rs`, `tore-session/tests/checkpoint_cost.rs`, the stub files, the `mod checkpoint` lines, `tools/battery_selection.py` rules | The traits, `Saver`, `Loader`, `Models`, macros, standard impls, flight helpers, shared leaf types; the container with versioning, identity and CRC; `World::checkpoint`, `restore`, `checkpoint_sections`, `restore_sections`; stubs; the radio section as the worked example; the harness with the scenarios the fixtures allow today, the twin restore and the whole-world test ignored until every section is covered; the measurement test | Unit tests of every standard impl, the macros' shared and skipped fields, shared records, flight states with one and two models per identity, the container's refusals (magic, version, switch, identity, CRC, framing, trailing bytes) and 10,000 damaged or random inputs without a panic, in both crates; the harness runs and reports `NotCovered` sections by name; single-player quick guard unchanged; the wire golden test unchanged. **Built (H0):** 14 unit tests in `tore-sim` and 4 harness tests (and the ignored whole-world test) in `tore-world`; the radio section restores into a twin in all three scenarios; a restored flight state flies on identically for two seconds; a field added to `Radio` without coding it failed to compile in its coder (checked by hand, then reverted) |
| H1 Records and sensors | Sonnet | H0 | `checkpoint_records.rs` (tore-sim), `sensors/track_checkpoint.rs`, `sensors/profile_checkpoint.rs`, `sensors/signature_checkpoint.rs`, `combat/threats_checkpoint.rs` | `Weapon` and its parts (tore-formats types, coded in `checkpoint_records.rs`), `live::Configuration` and `Station`, `SensorProfiles` and the profile types, `SignatureProfile`, `JammerProfile`, `Sensors` with contacts, strobes, plots and trails, `ThreatService` and its records; shared records for the big copies | Round trips of the crowd fixture's configurations, every ownship's and actor's sensors and threat services at ticks 300, 600 and 900; a weapon record carried by many stations codes once; sensors restored into a stepped copy step on identically for 600 ticks. **Built (H1, 2026-10-05):** every type of the row is coded with every field named and nothing skipped (the one scratch field, `Stored::current_this_tick` in the threat service, is coded anyway: it costs a bit and a restored service then compares equal). The weapon types and `Countermeasures` of `tore-formats` are coded in `checkpoint_records.rs` with `checkpoint_struct!`. *Agent decision:* a `Station`'s weapon is a shared record, and so is a `Configuration`'s `SensorProfiles` and a `Sensors`' copy of the same profiles, so an aircraft's suite costs an index beside its configuration; the configuration itself is plain, and callers code it with `Saver::shared`. `signature::Configuration` (the deployed fractions) is a per-step input, not state, and has no coder. A `Strobe`'s private line of sight is coded. In `tore-sim`: 13 unit tests (a 1,800-tick scripted sensor suite with a held track, strobes, stale plots and visual contacts restored at ticks 300, 600 and 900 and stepped on 600 ticks against the original; a threat service with all four evidence kinds, stale records and the same step-on; weapon records and configurations with the shared-record counts; damaged bytes); in `tore-world`, one crowd-fixture test round-trips every ownship's configuration, sensors and threat service, every AI actor's sensors and the dummy configurations at ticks 300, 600 and 900 (the crowd fight raises no missile warning by then, so the threat service's content is tested in `tore-sim`; an AI actor's own threat service is private to `AiActor` and is H4's). Sizes on the crowd fixture: four configurations in 540 bytes plus 3 shared records of 358 bytes; an ownship's sensors about 1.8 to 2.2 KB each (contacts, plots and trails), so about 60 KB for 30 aircraft before the profiles |
| H2 World shell | Sonnet | H0 | `tore-world/src/seats_checkpoint.rs`, `world_checkpoint.rs` (`Cockpit` and the roster, cockpits and weather sections), `tore-sim/src/airport_checkpoint.rs`, `environment_checkpoint.rs` | `Roster` and seats; `Cockpit` with its flight through `save_flight`, turbulence, stream, NAV mode and clocks; `airport::Service` with clearance and replies; `Environment`'s clock, ticks, fog stream, selection and tints, with a restore constructor that draws nothing | Round trips; the twin restore of roster and weather on the tick mission and the crowd fixture; the cockpits' twin once H6 and H7 merge **Built (H2, 2026-10-05):** `Roster` (planes, seats, `Pilot` with `Lost`, `Slot`), `Cockpit`, `airport::Service` (with `Reply`, `DeclineReason` and the clearance) and `Environment` are coded with every field named. Skipped: `Cockpit::previous_flight` (scratch: `plane::fly` begins each step by copying the flight into it; a restore sets it equal to the flight), `Environment::configuration` (setup). *Agent decision:* no restore constructor is needed. The weather section restores in place over the fresh `Environment`, which drew its first fog numbers when it was built, and overwrites the clock, ticks, stream, schedule and active list. The records are not coded whole: the fog callback rewrites only a record's tint scalar, so one value per record is coded and the count must match the fresh world's. The active list (blended copies) is coded whole, with `Layer`, `Deck` and `Callback` in `environment_checkpoint.rs`. *Agent decision:* a cockpit's aircraft identity (which names its flight model) is read from its plane's ownship in combat, so saving a cockpit whose plane has no ownship is an error; a real world never has one. *Agent decision:* `Roster::load` refuses planes or seats out of order, a pilot from a seat the roster lacks and a seat in a plane it lacks, since the roster binary-searches planes; a `Reply` nests `Repeated` at most 4 deep on loading. `WingId` and the wing `Side` are `tore-sim` types the trait cannot reach from `tore-world`, so a slot codes them field by field. In `tore-sim`: 6 unit tests (a service mid landing finishes the landing with the same events as its restored copy; every reply and decline reason; a weather clock with two fog layers restored into a fresh `Environment` after 35 seconds and 77 ticks draws and selects identically for 40 more seconds; another mission's weather is refused and changes nothing; damaged bytes). In `tore-world`: 3 roster unit tests (a roster with a lost plane, a waiting seat and a chosen wingman; the refusals; damaged bytes) and 3 world tests in `world/shell_checkpoint_tests.rs`: each scenario's roster, cockpits and weather at tick N restore into a world fresh from the build (an open mission has no cockpits there) with the original's structure and the same coding, the scenarios hold the state they are meant to (a tower conversation and turbulence in use; a seat waiting after a handoff), and damaged sections are refused without a panic. The cockpits' coder calls the result tracker, which slice H6 codes; since H6 merged (2026-10-05) the cockpit tests run in full and the twin restore covers the cockpits too. Sizes: a roster 25 to 56 bytes, a weather section 24 bytes (458 once the open mission's blended layers are in), a cockpit 375 to 656 bytes (the exact flight is most of it), so the shell is under 5 KB at 30 aircraft as estimated |
| H3a Combat core | Sonnet | H0 | `combat/live_checkpoint.rs`, `combat/live/rewind_checkpoint.rs`, `combat/missiles_checkpoint.rs`, `combat/missiles/seeker_checkpoint.rs`, `combat/ledger_checkpoint.rs`, `combat_checkpoint.rs` (tore-sim) | `live::State` with ownships, targets, ownship rows, projectiles, effects, the ledger, actor support, marks' list, rewinds and the rewind history (each frame against the one before), random streams, counters, the tick; missile `Flight`, `Seeker`, `Motion`, `Cruise`, `Profile`; `PlayerTrigger`, `FallState`. Calls H1's and H3b's types | Round trips of `live::State` at crowd fixture ticks with missiles guiding and rounds in flight; the rewind history's size against one second at 30 aircraft printed; the combat section's twin once H1 and H3b merge **Built (H3a, 2026-10-05):** `live::State` (as a value), `Ownship`, `Target`, `Projectile`, `Effect`, `Strike` (with `amount`), `HitRecord`, `ActorSupport`, `SystemFaults`, `LocalizedDamage`, missile `Flight`, `Profile`, `Motion`, `Cruise`, `Solution`, `FiringBand`, `Seeker`, `Observation`, `Heat` and `Status`, `Ledger`, `rewind::History`, `PlayerTrigger` and `FallState` are coded with every field named, in six files (the five `mod checkpoint` lines in `combat.rs`, `missiles.rs`, `missiles/seeker.rs`, `ledger.rs` and `live/rewind.rs` are the only edits to simulation files). Skipped, both why-records: `State::device_log` and `State::decoy_log`, and `Ledger::outcomes` (drained into the tick output every step). Everything that looks like a cache is coded: an ownship's `range_estimate` and `mounted_key`, the undrained `sound_events` and `strikes`, the hit records and `ownship_rows`. *Agent decision:* `ground_bounds` is coded too, because `State` is decoded as a value with no fresh state beside it to rebuild it from. *Agent decision:* weapon records (an AI round's own, and the configuration's) and a target's signature profile are shared records, so 40 rounds of one burst cost one coding. *Agent decision:* the deployed fractions `sensors::Configuration` (gear, flaps, bay), which H1 took for a per-step input, are held by every `Target` row between ticks, so they are coded here. *Agent decision:* ownships must decode strictly ascending by aircraft, as `add_ownship` keeps them, because they are found by bisection. *Agent decision:* the rewind history codes only the newest 61 of its 120 frames (`MAX_REWIND_TICKS` plus one): a lookup never rewinds further, host and state both cap it, so the older second is dead data that only falls off the front. A restored history is shorter until it fills again (`len` and `span` are read by tests only), and the original and a restored world write the same bytes. Each frame is coded against the one before, each volume against the same aircraft's (found by id), and a volume's `previous` position is one flag when it equals the earlier frame's `position`, which it always does for an aircraft recorded on consecutive ticks. Sizes: the crowd fixture's whole combat state is about 57 KB at ticks 300 to 900 (four ownships and four rows), 45 KB of it the history (5.7 KB per aircraft; about 170 KB for 30); the synthetic 30-aircraft turn costs 147 KB for 61 frames, against 242 KB raw. Exclusive-or coding of moving floats costs about 55 bits each, so the basis (nine floats per volume) is most of the history; predicting one basis column from the other two would save about a sixth of that. Tests: 20 unit tests in `tore-sim` (seeker, flight, ledger, history, trigger and fall, the state's parts, a whole state stepped on 600 ticks) and 3 in `tore-world` (the crowd fight at ticks 300, 600 and 900, the missile duel with a guided missile in flight, the damaged mission and the handoffs). The whole-state checks need the effects slice's types (H3b) and say so when skipped; the lead runs them once it merges. The combat section's twin waits for H3b's wrapper |
| H3b Combat effects and wrapper | Sonnet | H0 | `combat/smoke_checkpoint.rs`, `countermeasures_checkpoint.rs`, `debris_checkpoint.rs`, `blast_checkpoint.rs` (tore-sim); `tore-world/src/combat_checkpoint.rs`, `snapshot_checkpoint.rs` | `Smoke`, `Devices` with flares and chaff (the `f32` opacity), `Piece`, `Mark`, blast `Rolls`; the `Combat` wrapper restored in place, `Trigger`, `FireInput`, `Pose`, `RenderHistory` and the picture types | Round trips; smoke and countermeasures restored into a copy evolve identically for 600 ticks **Built (H3b, 2026-10-05):** every type of the row is coded with every field named. In `tore-sim`: `Smoke` with `Puff` and `Kind` (`smoke_checkpoint.rs`), `Devices` with `Flare`, `FlarePuff` and `Chaff` (`countermeasures_checkpoint.rs`), `Piece` (`debris_checkpoint.rs`), `Mark` with `MarkKind` and the blast `Rolls` (`blast_checkpoint.rs`). The flare puff's `f32` opacity is coded by its bits. In `tore-world`: the `Combat` wrapper (`combat_checkpoint.rs`) with `Trigger`, `FireInput`, `Pose` and `RenderHistory`, and the picture types (`snapshot_checkpoint.rs`: `RenderSnapshot`, `AircraftPose`, `Engine`, `Damage`, `ProjectilePose`, `EffectPose`, `MarkPose`, `DebrisPose`, `PilotPose`, `Draw`); the one `mod checkpoint` line in `snapshot.rs` is the only edit to a simulation file. *Agent decision:* `Combat` codes `live::State` (slice H3a's coder), then `contrail_sortie`, `contrails`, `triggers`, `ownship_contrails`, `poses`, `ai_poses` and the render history, and skips, each named at the destructuring: setup (`contrail_offsets`, `range`, `clean_recording`, `open`, `initial_ammo`, `dummies`, `mission_spawns`, `mission_layout`, `dummy_types`, `dummy_configs`, `airport_objects`), local (`tape`, `last_launcher`, `notes`) and, inside `RenderHistory`, `places` (rebuilt from the coded snapshots, as `set_current` and `advance` build it). `poses` is coded though every step rewrites it, because `refresh_picture` reads it between ticks when a command changes the scene. The wrapper's own fields are `Combat::save_wrapper` and `restore_wrapper` (`pub(crate)`), apart from the state, so they are tested before H3a merges; a restore decodes everything before it replaces anything. *Agent decision:* a puff, a flare, a chaff cloud and a snapshot's items are each coded against the item before (the render history's current snapshot against its previous one, so each aircraft is coded against itself a tick earlier): 1,008 smoke puffs cost 29.2 KB chained against 35.4 KB each alone (about 29 bytes a puff, so a full 7,200-puff contrail list is about 210 KB); a six-target snapshot costs 278 bytes against the previous one and 1,480 bytes alone. Whether that needs delta coding against the previous checkpoint is slice H9's measurement. The lists are refused above the caps the steps keep (`MAX_CONTRAIL_PUFFS`, `MAX_FLARES`, `MAX_PUFFS_PER_FLARE`, `MAX_CHAFF`). `EffectKind` belongs to `tore-sim` and the trait cannot be implemented for it from `tore-world`, so `snapshot_checkpoint.rs` codes it by an exhaustive `match` in two helpers. In `tore-sim`: 13 unit tests (smoke with all four kinds and moving contrail outlets, and flares with their puffs, chaff and the release count, each restored into a copy that evolves identically for 600 ticks with equal codings every 30; a flare that landed and one that burned out; the opacity bits; marks of every kind with NaN and infinite positions; the variety stream drawing the same explosions; a tumbling piece landing where the original does; the caps; damaged and cut bytes). In `tore-world`: 11 unit tests (a snapshot with every list filled; a snapshot against the one before; unknown variants; damaged bytes; a lived-in `Combat` whose wrapper restores exactly, with the lookups the picture makes working on the rebuilt places; a history that just started over; setup and local fields kept; a refused restore leaving the wrapper alone; damaged bytes; the whole section, which skips with a message until H3a merges; and the wrapper twin restore on a real open mission: two worlds flown to tick 330 with two humans firing, the original given smoke and an inhibited trigger, the twin's wrapper scrambled and restored from the original's bytes, both flown on 400 ticks with equal tick effects, smoke and pictures every tick and equal codings every 20; skipping the trigger, pose or picture restore in turn failed it, checked by hand and reverted). The wrapper is 12.9 KB on that mission at tick 330, with 900 ticks of smoke in it. The harness's twin restore covers the whole combat section once H3a merges |
| H4 AI mission | Sonnet | H0 | `ai/mission_checkpoint.rs`, `ai/airfield_checkpoint.rs`, `awareness_checkpoint.rs`, `incoming_fire_checkpoint.rs`, `defense_checkpoint.rs`, `engagement_checkpoint.rs`, `opportunity_checkpoint.rs`, `damage_checkpoint.rs`, `route_checkpoint.rs`, `ejection_checkpoint.rs` (tore-sim) | `AiMission` and `AiActor` with every field coded or skipped by class, the airfield `Sequence` and orders, `Memory`, `Lookout`, defense, incoming fire, assignments, opportunities, route types, the escape monitor. Calls H1's and H5's types | Round trips of `AiMission` in the tore-sim AI golden fixtures (airfield, landing, defense) by the existing debug-and-flight-bytes oracle; a restored mission steps on identically for 600 ticks there **Built (H4, 2026-10-05):** `AiMission` and `AiActor` are coded with every field named, in ten files (the nine `mod checkpoint` lines in `awareness`, `incoming_fire`, `defense`, `engagement`, `opportunity`, `damage`, `route`, `airfield` and `ejection` are the only edits to simulation files). An actor's flight goes through `save_flight` with its identity's aircraft, and its controller, sensors and threat service through H5's and H1's coders. Skipped, each with its class at the skip: `AiMission::journal`, `AiActor::trace` and `journal_memory` (why-records); `AiMission::{missiles, gun_rounds}` (scratch: the host sets both before every step, `AiWings::step` and the golden fixtures included, and only `update_defense` reads them, so a test that sets them once must set them again after a restore); `AiActor::adapter` (`last_requested` is read by nothing in the simulation and `gun_aim` is cleared and set again inside each step). `last_input` was skipped as scratch too (read only by the formation trace and the replay recorder's control display, and rewritten by every step that flies); slice H9's golden round trip found that a destroyed actor never flies again and keeps its last controls, so H9 codes it (with `PilotInput` in `checkpoint_shared.rs`). *Agent decision:* `last_defense` is coded whole, `DefenseDebug` included, because the next tick reads whether the decision flew a motion and the debug type has no empty value to rebuild; `pending_threats`, `pending_events`, `device_schedule`, `observed_attacks`, `ignored_attack_ids` and `received_emitters` are coded because a later tick reads each. *Agent decision:* an actor's copied records are shared records: its home runway, its landing order, its ground start and its airfield sequence share the runway view (a mission of 30 actors on one runway costs one coding of it), and so does each gun's weapon record. `Delay` and `ProjectilePacing` (the stores' timings, in `StationSpec`) are coded here, in `mission_checkpoint.rs`, through `Delay`'s public API, since `weapon_service` is H5's. The real golden fixtures' builders are private to `golden_tests/ai.rs`, so the acceptance is met on scripted missions rebuilt in `mission_checkpoint_tests.rs` (slice H9 later ran the real golden missions through a restore, below): a six-aircraft fight with an infrared missile and tracer fire at an actor, a hit, a launch warning, an attack report, a human leader lost at tick 700 (the lead passes and a mission of opportunity starts), assignments, a priority landing and a wing route; ground starts on an unanchored and an anchored runway; and a landing from 40,000 ft out to parking. Each restores at six ticks of the fight (1, 220, 340, 460, 800 and 1,200) and at the first tick of every airfield phase it passes through, and the restored copy steps on 600 ticks with equal outputs, equal flight states every tick and byte-equal codings every 30 ticks. Other tests cover the gun and runway sharing (two records for five actors), every value type, damaged and cut bytes, and the monitor's random stream; replacing a field's load by a default in the actor coder failed the fight test (checked, then reverted) |
| H5 AI controller | Sonnet | H0 | `ai/controller_checkpoint.rs`, `motion_checkpoint.rs`, `steering_checkpoint.rs`, `gunnery_checkpoint.rs`, `wing_checkpoint.rs`, `formation_checkpoint.rs`, `weapon_service_checkpoint.rs`, `pursuit_checkpoint.rs`, `threat_checkpoint.rs` (tore-sim) | `Controller` and everything it owns: the manoeuvre and intents, the last intent batch, gunnery cycles and views, formation guidance and variation, recipient state, weapon service and stores, searches, defense motion, pending warnings, frame events, threat reports | Every controller of the AI golden fixtures at three ticks round-trips equal (`Controller` is `PartialEq`) **Built (H5, 2026-10-05):** `Controller` and its 40 coded fields, with 52 coders (types and enums) across the nine files (the eight `mod checkpoint` lines in `motion`, `steering`, `gunnery`, `wing`, `formation`, `weapon_service`, `pursuit` and `threat` are the only edits to simulation files). Skipped, each with its proof at the skip: `gun_views` and `formation_traffic` (scratch: the mission writes both before every `Controller::step`) and `trace` (why-record). *Agent decision:* `formation::Guidance::trace` is **coded**, not skipped: it is called a hidden inspection hook, but `Guidance::change_slot` reads whether it is set and the mission feeds each actor's trace phase and planned velocity into the others' traffic. The golden fixtures' builders are private to `golden_tests/ai.rs`, so the acceptance is met on a scripted crew rebuilt in `controller_checkpoint_tests.rs` (leader, wingman and ace under orders, warnings, hits, a gun and missile stores; a wingman reslotting around traffic): every controller round-trips equal to the original but for the scratch every 60 ticks and at ticks 600, 1,500 and 2,800, and a restored copy steps on with identical batches for 240 ticks; a field dropped from the coder by hand failed the crew test (checked, then reverted) |
| H6 AI wings | Sonnet | H0 | `tore-world/src/ai_wings_checkpoint.rs`, `ai_wings/reports_checkpoint.rs`, `chatter_checkpoint.rs`, `outcome_checkpoint.rs` | `AiWings` restored in place (slots, humans, configurations as shared records, damaged stations, handed-over skills, the two streams, pending guns, last hit points, activities, the projectile counter, HUD line state, `ai_shots`); reports, chatter watch, result tracker | Round trips in the crowd fixture; the AI wings section's twin once H1, H4 and H5 merge **Built (H6, 2026-10-05):** `AiWings` is restored in place and its coder (`ai_wings_checkpoint.rs`) names every field: the AI mission (a value, H4's coder), the formation reports, the slots, the humans, the flight model setting, the weapons and configurations (each value a shared record, so equal ones cost one coding), the two random streams, the damaged stations, handed-over and mission skills, pending gun bursts and gun ordinals, last hit points, activities, the projectile counter, the shot attribution, the threat reports, the HUD line state (shown aircraft, held line, pending line, last message tick), the chatter events and the chatter watch (`chatter_checkpoint.rs`), and the two cheat settings (`enemy_skill`, `guns_only`). The mission result `Tracker` (`outcome_checkpoint.rs`) is coded whole. Skipped: `mission_preset` (setup: written when the world is built and never read), `airfields` (setup), `formation_trace` (local: the app's CSV feed), `last_output` and `decoy_rolls` (why-records the next step rewrites), `Watch::names` and `Watch::seats` (setup: learned from the mission's aircraft types at build), `Watch::engage_until` and `Watch::journal` (why-records), and the formation reports' journal entries, notes and `held` (why-records, `reports_checkpoint.rs`). *Agent decision:* the AI mission is coded by value (H4's `Checkpoint` stub), so a restore replaces the fresh bridge's mission and everything else in place; the bridge's own coding is `AiWings::save_bridge` and `restore_bridge` (`pub(crate)`) so it is tested before H4 merges. *Agent decision:* `launch::Side` and `Rules` belong to `tore-sim`, so a side is one bit and the weapon rules a varint, in helpers beside the coder; `Release` (a radio release) and `Elevation` are `tore-world` types only the AI's events carry, so their coders sit in `chatter_checkpoint.rs`. *Agent decision:* `weapon_rules` is coded though the next step copies it from combat first, since it costs a varint and nothing proves every path reads it only after that copy. In `tore-world`: 17 unit tests beside the coders (a bridge with every field away from its start value restores into a fresh one and codes the same bytes; a restore keeps the fresh bridge's setup and replaces its structure; the why-records and setup cost no bytes; every radio event and fuel level; the watch restores in place and keeps its names; a report queue restored mid-conversation reports on identically for four more observations; every tracker state; refused out-of-order maps; damaged bytes) and 4 world tests in `world/ai_wings_checkpoint_tests.rs`: the bridge at five ticks of every scenario restores into a world built fresh and holds and codes the same, the open mission's humans come from the checkpoint and not the build, and damaged bridge bytes never panic. The scenarios never hold a gun burst, a shot, a damaged station or a radio event between ticks, so those are tested on constructed bridges (H8's scenarios add the AI firing). With the tracker coded the cockpits section codes whole and H2's cockpit tests no longer skip. Sizes: the bridge is 100 to 235 bytes in the scenarios; with H4's mission in a scratch merge the whole AI wings section is 3.8 KB on the single-player tick mission, 22.5 KB on the crowd fight (8 aircraft) and 8.1 KB on the open mission, so the mission's actors are most of it. In that scratch merge the harness's coverage line lists the AI wings section and the twin restore passes on all three scenarios (600 ticks each); a world test (`the_whole_section_restores_into_a_fresh_world_once_the_mission_is_coded`) restores the section into a fresh world and expects the same bytes, and skips with a message until H4 is in |
| H7 Radio | Sonnet | H0 | `tore-world/src/comms_checkpoint.rs`, `airfield_radio_checkpoint.rs`, `crew_voice_checkpoint.rs` | `Comms` with channels, pending calls, cooldown keys by table, the stream; `WingStatus`; `AirfieldRadio`; `CrewVoice` (the radio section's `Radio` is H0's worked example) | Round trips; the comms and wing status sections' twins on the tick mission with calls pending **Built (H7, 2026-10-05):** `Comms` (channels, pending calls, both cooldown maps, the stream, the call serial and the clock), `WingStatus`, `AirfieldRadio` (with its departure, approach and waiting notices) and `CrewVoice` are coded with every field named. Skipped, all why-records: `Comms::journal`, `Channel::recent`, `Call::origin`, `AirfieldRadio::notes` and `CrewVoice::gate` (a restored voice journals its first gate again). *Agent decision:* the seven cooldown keys are a fixed table in `comms_checkpoint.rs` (`COOLDOWN_KEYS`, coded by index); a key a rule uses that is not in the table fails the checkpoint with its name, and a unit test reads `radio_calls.rs` and `crew_voice.rs` to catch one before it ships. *Agent decision:* the runway views an `AirfieldRadio` holds are shared records, so a departure and an approach on the same runway cost one coding. In `tore-world`: 19 unit tests beside the coders (a radio with calls pending delivers on identically for ten seconds of ticks after a restore; a scripted crew voice speaks on identically for 2,000 ticks after a restore; a tower conversation delivers its three waiting notices identically; damaged bytes) and 3 world tests in `world/radio_checkpoint_tests.rs`: the tick mission's own tower conversation and crew voice round trip at five ticks, and on the tick mission and on the crowd fight the comms, wing status and radio sections restore into a twin that was never given calls the original holds (three calls with delays, two cooldowns), which then delivers them with the same cues for 900 ticks. The scenario harness's own twin has no call pending at tick N in any of the three scenarios, which is why these tests inject them. The coders of `AirfieldRadio` and `CrewVoice` run inside the cockpits section, so their twin is H2's once it merges |
| H8 Scenarios | Sonnet | H0 | `world/checkpoint_scenarios.rs`, `tore-world/src/test_support/resources.rs` | A synthetic import with an airport so `World::new` builds a ground start; the tick mission's wing ordered to land; a weather configuration that reselects inside the run; each scenario's state assertions at tick N | Each scenario builds twice identically and reaches its asserted state; nothing in the existing tests changes **Built (H8, 2026-10-05):** ten scenarios in `world/checkpoint_scenarios.rs`: H0's three with their state now asserted, and seven new (damaged aircraft, handoffs in the fight, missile duel, radio calls pending, AI landing, ground start, changing weather). Each `Scenario` has an `expect` that asserts the state it exists for at tick N and returns a note, and an optional `after` that asserts a later state; one test builds every scenario twice, compares the covered sections of the two builds, and runs both checks. `airport_resources()` in `test_support/resources.rs` is the synthetic import with one airport added to the theater's layout (a runway object whose shape holds the contact boxes the airfield's takeoff, landing and parking read, laid out as `tore-sim`'s airfield golden scenario lays them), so `World::new` builds a real ground start with the airport's anchors; `resources()` is unchanged, so no existing test sees the airport. No simulation file changed. *Agent decisions:* (1) The AI landing is the airport import's airborne mission, not the tick mission: the tick mission's AI aircraft are not an addressable wing (its landing order is answered "no addressed wingmen"), its airport has no taxi points, and its wingmen did not reach the final in 9,000 ticks. The two wingmen start at the first approach gate and 16,000 ft behind it, because the AI flies the three gates at its approach speed, which takes about 8,000 ticks to the final; the checkpoint is at 12,500, in the rollout (which lasts from tick 11,900 to 13,250), so this scenario runs 14,100 ticks. (2) The ground start's wingmen go from waiting straight to lining up (they queue beside the takeoff spot, so no `Taxi` phase is reached) and wait for the player's roll, so the checkpoint is at 2,000 and the run 1,400, not 240 and 900. (3) The crowd fixture's second station is not a seeker missile and its AI fires nothing and hits nothing, so no missile is in flight there: the missile and warning assertions are made on the missile duel (the open mission's real AIM-9 profile; the humans fire), and the damage scenario deals its damage with the development damage command and by setting a target row and an AI pilot's escape by hand, as the AI wings' own tests do. (4) H0's crowd fight keeps its script (no designation): a designation makes the guns call a radio line, which starts a cooldown the H7 twin test needs free at tick 600. The leaders designate in the damage and handoff scenarios, where the locks are asserted. (5) The weather scenario runs the fog callback on both layers so the layers are reselected every second of mission time, and ends the first layer five seconds in so the active layer changes inside the run. (6) The radio scenario asserts a waiting call by comparing the Comms section with the same mission's without the calls, because the channel's queue is private and its journal is drained each step. Timing: the test takes about 5 s in a debug build |
| H10 Data link and score | Sonnet | H0, G0, F2-S (and each later G slice that adds state) | `tore-world/src/datalink_checkpoint.rs` (new), `score_checkpoint.rs` (new), the two `mod checkpoint` lines in `datalink.rs` and `score.rs`, the `datalink` and `score` lines and two sections in `tore-world/src/checkpoint.rs`, `world/datalink_checkpoint_tests.rs` | Code `DataLink` (members, pictures with their publish ticks, locks, engagements, assignments, the warned tables; the journal by the why-record rule) and add its section; code the score `Recorder` (the scoring switch, the targets whose end is recorded) and add its section; the state the [data link](#flight-data-link) names for stage H as each G slice lands. **From now on each G slice that adds `DataLink` state codes it in `datalink_checkpoint.rs` as part of its own slice** (the destructuring will not compile until it does), and says so in its row | Round trips of the picture on the crowd fixture at ticks before and after a publish; the twin restore of the data link section; the equivalence scenarios assert the link's and the recorder's state at tick N; added by the lead on 2026-10-05 when G0 gave `World` its `datalink` field (named as not yet coded in the destructuring until this slice). **Built (H10, 2026-10-05):** two sections, the data link (id 9) and the score recorder (id 10). `DataLink` is coded whole with every field named: the tick, the members (flight, aircraft, radar, human and alive flags, position), the pictures (publish tick, tracks, member status), the locks with the tick each was first held, the engagements, the assignments table (G0 already holds it, so it is coded now, with the player order by a fixed number each), both warning tables and the set of announced planes. Skipped: `journal` (why-record: nothing reads it back, and a restored link starts with none waiting). *Agent decisions:* (1) `announced` is a journal gate, which the rule makes a why-record, but it is coded anyway: it is a few bits, and a restored link then does not announce every plane to the journal again. (2) `WingId`, its side and `PlayerOrder` are `tore-sim` types, so their coders are functions beside the `DataLink` coder (a number each, a `match` with no `_` arm) rather than trait impls. (3) The recorder section is a flag (scoring on) and the `Recorder`: the recorded targets **and** the facts waiting for the host, with their tick. The brief called the pending facts not state because the host drains them after every step, but coding them costs a few bytes when empty and makes a checkpoint taken anywhere in the host's loop exact. A restore sets `World::score` as the checkpoint had it, the switch included. In `tore-world`: 6 unit tests beside the coders (a link with every table filled, the empty link, every player order, refused numbers, a recorder with every kind of fact waiting) and 5 tests on whole worlds (the picture restored at 13 ticks around publishes on the crowd fight with handoffs; a link wiped from a twin and restored steps on identically for 300 steps, with a check that the wipe alone differs; the scoring switch and recorded targets both ways; 10,000 damaged sections without a panic). The scenarios now assert the link at tick N in four of the ten (published pictures with the right member count; both wings holding tracks; two locks and their engagements) and the damaged-aircraft scenario turns scoring on and asserts the recorded kill and its fact waiting. The whole-world equivalence passes on all ten scenarios with `--ignored`; the new sections cost 177 to 859 bytes for the link and one byte for the recorder when scoring is off. Single player: SAME (coders only read; no simulation file changed but the two `mod` lines). The assignments table is empty in the ten scenarios (no scenario has a human lead give an order), so a test on the assignment tests' fight holds a live one: once just given and once acknowledged by a wingman, it restores into a fresh world and into a twin whose link was wiped, which steps on with the same table for 120 steps (a mutation that skips the table fails it). |
| H9 Integration and measurement | lead (Opus) | all | the harness's ignore markers, docs, baseline | Un-ignore the whole-world equivalence; run every scenario; measure sizes, encode, restore and catch-up on the synthetic crowd and on the 15 against 15 mission with real data; delta-code against the previous checkpoint only if the size needs it; fold the results into the budget and a `docs/baselines/` entry | Every scenario passes bit for bit on every CI platform; a field added without coding fails to compile (shown once, by hand); the measured figures recorded against the budget **Built (H9, 2026-10-05):** the whole-world equivalence runs in the normal suite (about 7 s in a debug build for all scenarios, so no long form is needed), and the coverage test now requires every section. A scenario added here, a human lead's order (`lead_order`), holds data link assignments at the checkpoint, one acknowledged and two not yet, and its target is shot down inside the run. The AI golden fixtures gained a hook at the start of every tick; `restoring_the_ai_missions_mid_flight_changes_no_behaviour` swaps the engagement and airfield missions for restored copies 792 times and gets the same fingerprints (the recorded values did not change). It found that `AiActor::last_input` is not scratch (a destroyed actor stops flying and keeps it), so H9 codes it, with `PilotInput`, `PilotCommand` and `Switch` coders in `checkpoint_shared.rs`. A field added to `DataLink` failed to compile in its coder only (checked by hand, then removed). The measurement (`tore-session/tests/checkpoint_cost.rs`, ignored, real data) now takes a checkpoint every 10 seconds of the first minute and at two and five minutes, breaks the two big sections down by part, checks that the restored copy and the original reach the same state 1,200 ticks later, and measures what is unchanged since the previous checkpoint; the results are in the [baseline](baselines/checkpoint-2026-10-05.md). *Agent decision:* no delta coding against the previous checkpoint: the size is over the budget only in the furball (up to 1.0 MB), where 2 to 3 percent is unchanged after 10 seconds; the cheaper levers are listed for stage K |

Every slice from H1 to H8 can run at the same time: their files are
disjoint and the stubs make each compile alone. With four or five agents at
once, *agent proposal:* a first wave of H1, H5, H2, H7 and H8 (the types the
others call, and the fixtures), then H3a, H3b, H4 and H6. The merge order
that completes sections soonest is H1, H5, H4, H6 (the AI wings section),
then H3b, H3a (combat), then H7, H2 (the rest).

**Single player.** No slice changes simulation behaviour: coders only read,
and restore runs only in tests until stage K. Each slice runs the quick check
(battery-free for `*_checkpoint.rs` files, which the battery map routes to no
scenario) and the single-player quick guard. The full single-player baseline
is needed only if a slice must touch a simulation file, which it should not.

**Stage G.** The data link adds a shared picture and radio frequencies. If
they become new `World` fields, each gets a section id and a coder in its own
`*_checkpoint.rs`; if they live inside `AiWings` or `Comms`, they join that
section's coder, whose field list will not compile until they are named.

## Compatibility

Design for stage L of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written on 2026-10-05 by a design agent for the lead. The wire is in
[the protocol's compatibility section](formats/net-protocol.md#compatibility-stage-l);
what a player sees is in the guide's
[compatibility handshake](MULTIPLAYER.md#compatibility-handshake). The slice
table below marks each slice that is built.

John's decisions bind it: the T.O.R.E build and protocol must match
(2026-09-28, with the match rule approved on 2026-09-30); a 1.0 import and a
1.02F import play together once verified (approved 2026-09-30, verified by
slice D3a); the lobby offers only aircraft and theaters that every human in
the session has, and a player missing something is told why in plain words
instead of a failed join (the feature spec, 2026-09-28). Every other choice
here is an agent proposal.

In short:

- Stage D already plays a 1.0 player with a 1.02F player: everything the
  simulation reads is byte for byte the same in both imports. What is missing
  is knowing it in advance. Today a difference shows up only once a mission is
  built, as a list of file names.
  A full comparison of everything the two imports keep (4,157 entries; 50
  differ only in a header timestamp the game never reads) is in
  [the builds audit](baselines/fa-builds-2026-10-06.md).
- Each game works out its **content**: one entry per aircraft, theater and
  weapon it can load, plus the shared data every mission reads, each with a
  hash of exactly the files that item reads. It also says which Fighters
  Anthology build it imported and which T.O.R.E made the import.
- A joining game sends its content to the host once. The host compares every
  player's content with its own and tells everyone the **gaps**: the items
  some human cannot use, and who. Usually there are none.
- The King's creator dims what is in a gap and says why; the host refuses a
  mission or a loadout that uses it, with the same words. The lobby does not
  show a player's Fighters Anthology build (John, 2026-10-06: the build audit,
  `baselines/fa-builds-2026-10-06.md`, found 1.0 and 1.02F identical in
  everything a player sees or the simulation reads); a line says how a
  player's items differ from the host's.
- A player who joins a lobby whose mission it cannot fly stays, is marked
  unable, and everyone reads why ("Hawk's game has no Su-27, which this
  mission flies."). The exact check of stage D stays as the last word, now
  explained by item.
- One new protocol version, two new messages and one new field in the lobby
  state. No new dependency. Single player is unchanged.

### What the survey found

Read at `d7244b0c` (the `multiplayer` tip):

- **The build rule.** The handshake refuses another protocol version (code
  1) or another T.O.R.E build (code 2: two tagged releases match by version,
  anything else by commit; `tore_session::host::config`,
  `builds_match_by_commit_or_by_a_release_version`). Direct Connection and the
  Internet Lobby already show a game of another build dimmed and say "runs
  another version (...) and cannot be joined" (`direct_screen/mod.rs`,
  `internet_screen/mod.rs`); the master filters by build
  (`tore_master::browse::same_build`). Two players who can join each other
  therefore run the same code, the same aircraft list and the same theater
  list. Stage L leaves this alone.
- **The content check.** `tore_world::resources::ResourceReads` notes every
  resource a build asks for; `Manifest` is the sorted names with an FNV-1a 64
  hash each, `Manifest::digest` one number for it, `Manifest::differences` the
  names that disagree. The host sends its manifest in the Mission message and
  the loadouts' additions in Flight loadouts. The client builds the mission
  from its own import (`Client::build_mission` in
  `tore-session/src/client/mod.rs`) and on a difference sends Content refused
  with the names and the line "Your game data differs from the host's in 3
  file(s), such as SU27.PT. Import the same version of the game." The host
  keeps that line as the player's `unable` text (`Host::content_refused`), and
  the lobby state carries it to every player, so other players also read
  "Your game data differs...".
- **1.0 and 1.02F.** Slice D3a imported both builds and compared the packs:
  4,093 resources each, every one of the 1,405 the simulation reads
  byte-identical, 24 presentation files (menus, dialogs, HUD layouts and three
  unread mission modules) different only in a four-byte link timestamp
  ([result](formats/esa-installer.md#the-import-pack-under-both-builds)). Both
  builds already pass each other's content check. But nothing records which
  build a player imported: `tore_import::import` identifies the executable
  (`tore_formats::executable::identify`) and writes the build only to the
  `FA.EXE:` line of `import-report.txt`, not into the pack.
- **What can really differ** between two players of the same T.O.R.E build:
  1. *An import made by an older T.O.R.E.* The creator lists only the
     aircraft whose `.PT` the import holds (`QuickMission::new` filters
     `AircraftId::SELECTABLE`). The pack's markers (`tore_import::check_markers`)
     force a re-import only for the kinds they name. The `import-variety`
     branch, for example, grows `SELECTABLE` from 14 to 37 aircraft with no
     new marker, so after it lands a King who has re-imported can pick an
     aircraft that a friend's older import lacks. This is the likely case.
  2. *A damaged or edited file* in one player's data folder.
  3. *Mods and custom aircraft, later.* Nothing exists yet; the F/A-XX is a
     built-in variant of `F22N.PT` (`AircraftId::Faxx`), not a mod.
- **Every grid in every manifest.** `Terrain::build` (`tore-world/src/terrain.rs`)
  asks the theater catalog for its label, and
  `ResourceReads::theater_catalog` notes all sixteen `.T2` grids, because
  `tore_formats::theater::map_catalog` parses them all. So every mission's
  manifest holds every grid, and a bad grid of any theater fails every
  mission. The label needs only the mission's own grid (a base theater's
  label is its grid's name; a `~` variant's is its base's name and the
  variant).
- **What the King can choose.** The creator's aircraft (the selectable ones
  the import has) and its sixteen base theaters (`source_theaters`); the
  lobby's Load Ordnance page offers every `.JT` in the pack that parses
  (`Ordnance::new` in `ordnance.rs`). `QuickMission::lobby_spec` refuses what a
  host cannot take before anything is sent. The host refuses a mission its
  build fails, with the build's words (`Host::change_mission`), and a loadout
  `LoadoutSpec::check_in` refuses.
- **The lobby.** Each player in the lobby state has an `unable` reason and,
  since protocol 7, a platform. The screen shows a red cross and "Unable",
  and the hint line gives the reason (`lobby_screen/facts.rs`, `hint`,
  `player_rows`).
- **The operator.** `tore-server --check` prints the mission's manifest size
  and digest (`tore-server/src/check.rs`).
- **Loading a weapon reads its `.JT` only** (`LoadoutSpec::apply` in
  `tore-world/src/mission.rs`); loading an aircraft type reads its `.PT` and
  its sensors (`AircraftType::load`), and its combat configuration reads its
  default stores' weapons and equipment (`live::Configuration::from_source`).

### Content items

*Agent proposal.* A game's **content** is a list of items. An item is
something a player chooses, or the data under every choice. Each item has a
kind, a key, the names of the resources it reads and a digest: FNV-1a 64 over
those names and their hashes, coded as `Manifest::digest` codes a manifest.
Two games whose item digests are equal simulate that item from the same
bytes.

| Kind | Key | What its digest covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aircraft | The creator's selection key (`F18.PT`, `faxx`) | What `AircraftType::load` and the combat configuration of the type read: the profile, its sensors, its default stores' weapons and equipment |
| Theater | The theater code (`UKR`) | What `Terrain::build` reads for the theater under each of the six weather conditions: its layout, its own grid, the condition layers, the placed objects and their shapes |
| Weapon | The weapon record (`AIM9X.JT`) | The record itself, the only file a loadout reads for it |
| Shared | `shared` | What every mission reads beyond its own items: the radio phrases, and whatever else a build is found to read (measured on a real import in L1: the 299 radio phrase recordings and nothing else) |

- **Which items.** Every selectable aircraft and every base theater the code
  knows (the same lists in every game of one build), every weapon record the
  import holds that the Load Ordnance page would offer, and the shared item.
  An item the import cannot load (a file missing or unreadable) is left out:
  the game does not have it.
- **How an item is read.** By running the item's own loader through a
  `ResourceReads`, so the names are what the mission core really reads, not a
  list kept by hand. The shared item is a **reference build**: a small mission
  built from the first aircraft and theater the import has, less the names of
  its own items. A probe may stop before the costly derived data (heights and
  normals) if its names stay the same. *Built (L1):* none needed to; every
  probe runs its full loader (see [Cost](#cost)).
- **The coverage rule** keeps the items honest, the way the checkpoint's
  equivalence keeps the checkpoint honest: for every mission tested, its
  manifest is inside the shared item and its own items (its aircraft, its
  theater, its loadouts' weapons), and the shared item is inside its
  manifest. A future read that belongs to no item, or a shared read that only
  some missions make, fails the test, and its author moves it into the right
  probe.
- **The catalog fix.** The terrain asks for its own grid only when it labels
  the theater (a `ResourceSource::theater_label(code)` beside
  `theater_catalog`), so a theater is one item and a bad grid fails only its
  own theater. Labels are unchanged; every manifest loses the fifteen other
  grids.

The game keeps the names of each item in memory; only the digests travel.

### The source: build and importer

*Agent proposal.* The import writes one more pack entry, `TORE_SOURCE_V1`, a
short text: the Fighters Anthology build as `tore_formats::executable` names
it (`1.0 (disc)` or `1.02F`) and the version and commit of the T.O.R.E that
made the import. Nothing in single player reads it. A pack made before stage
L has no such entry; the game then reads the build from the `FA.EXE:` line of
`import-report.txt` beside the pack, and the importer is unknown. No re-import
is asked for.

`tore_import::source::Source::read(data_dir, &resources)` gives the build
(1.0, 1.02F or unknown) and the importer (a version and commit, or unknown).

### Joining

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Joining game
  participant H as Host
  participant O as Every player
  C->>H: Connect, as today
  H->>C: Accepted, then the lobby and the Mission
  C->>H: Content: FA build, importer, item digests
  H->>H: Compare with its own content, find the gaps
  H->>O: Lobby state (each player's FA build) and Content gaps, when they change
  C->>C: Build the mission, the exact check
  alt it cannot play the mission
    C->>H: Content refused, as today
    H->>O: The player is unable, in words about the item
  end
```

- **Content** is the joining game's first reliable message. It is computed
  before the join from the game's import, and only once for each import: the
  game starts it on a worker when a multiplayer screen first opens, so single
  player never pays for it; `tore-server` and `tore-bot` compute it at start.
  A host, a client or a bot given none computes it itself.
- **The host's own content is the reference**: the dedicated server's, or the
  hosting game's. A player whose item digest differs from the host's cannot
  use that item, exactly as one that lacks it. An item a player has and the
  host lacks is in a gap too, which matters when a player is King on a
  dedicated server.
- **The gaps** are every item that at least one connected human, or the host,
  lacks or has with another digest, each with who. Every connection counts,
  in the lobby, flying, observing or unable, since each one builds the
  mission. A player whose Content has not arrived yet does not count until it
  does (it is the first message, so this lasts a round trip). The host sends
  the gaps to every player when it has a new player's content and whenever
  they change (a join, a leave); a lobby with none sends an empty list once.
- **The lobby state** carries each player's Fighters Anthology build beside
  its platform. The game's screens do not show it (L5); it stays on the wire
  because removing it needs a protocol version of its own.

### What the lobby offers

*Agent proposals.*

- **The King's creator** (lobby mode only) shows an aircraft or a theater in
  a gap dimmed. Choosing one leaves the choice as it was and puts the reason
  in the creator's notice: "Not everyone can fly the Su-27: Hawk's game has
  no Su-27." Accept checks the whole mission the same way before anything is
  sent. Single player's creator is unchanged.
- **The lobby's Load Ordnance page** refuses a weapon in a gap with the same
  kind of line ("Not everyone has the AGM-65G: Hawk's game has no AGM-65G.").
- **The host refuses** a Change mission whose aircraft or theater is in a gap,
  and a Loadout whose weapon is, with the same words as a Refused, whatever
  the King's game showed. A dedicated server's own mission file is the
  operator's choice and is not refused: a player who cannot fly it is unable.
- **A player who cannot fly the mission in the lobby** is marked unable as
  today, and the reason the host keeps is now in the third person ("Hawk's
  game has no Su-27, which this mission flies."). The player's own screen
  keeps its second-person line ("Your game has no Su-27, which this mission
  flies. Re-import Fighters Anthology (Pref, Re-import) to add it."). The
  King can change the mission, now offered only what everyone has.
- **The shared item in a gap** restricts nothing (no choice avoids it): the
  player is unable for every mission, and the words say so.

### The words

*Agent proposals*; the code keeps them in one place in each crate (the host's
in `tore-session/src/host/content.rs`, the player's own in
`tore-session/src/client/content.rs`). An item is named by its label: the
aircraft's (`AircraftId::label`), the theater's (its grid's name), the
weapon's (its record's name), each from the host's import, or its key when
the host lacks it. A list of players names up to three callsigns, then "and 2
more".

| When | Who reads it | Line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The King picks an item in a gap | The King, in the creator's notice; the host's Refused says the same | "Not everyone can fly the Su-27: Hawk's game has no Su-27." / "...: Hawk's Su-27 differs from the host's." / "...: the server has no Su-27." / a theater: "Not everyone has Vietnam: ..." |
| A loadout uses a weapon in a gap | The player, on the page; the host's Refused | "Not everyone has the AGM-65G: Hawk's game has no AGM-65G." |
| A player cannot fly the mission | Everyone, in the hint for that player and in Messages | "Hawk's game has no Su-27, which this mission flies." / "Hawk's Su-27 differs from the host's." / "Hawk's game data differs from the host's in 3 files, such as CRATER.SH." |
| The same, the player's own | The player, in its hint and Messages | "Your game has no Su-27, which this mission flies. Re-import Fighters Anthology (Pref, Re-import) to add it." When its importer is older than this build: "Your import was made by an earlier T.O.R.E (0.1.3). Re-import Fighters Anthology (Pref, Re-import) to add it." A differing item: "Your Su-27's data differs from the host's." The shared item: "Your game's shared flight data differs from the host's (3 files, such as CRATER.SH). Re-import Fighters Anthology with this version of T.O.R.E." |
| A player joins whose items differ from the host's | Everyone, once, in Messages | "Hawk's game differs from the host's: no Su-27, a different AIM-9X." |
| The same, the joining player | The joiner | "Your game differs from the host's: no Su-27." |
| A player is selected in Players | Everyone, in the hint | "Hawk: on Linux." (or the unable reason) |

Nothing is said when a player's items equal the host's, and nothing about
which Fighters Anthology build a player imported (John, 2026-10-06, replacing
the earlier "Hawk imported Fighters Anthology 1.0; the host, 1.02F" line and
the build in the hint). The exact
check of stage D stays: the client attributes each differing name to the
items whose names hold it, and to the shared data otherwise, and words its
Content refused with the lines above; the names travel as before.

### A dedicated server

- `tore-server --check` adds the source ("Fighters Anthology 1.02F, imported
  by T.O.R.E 0.1.4 (48d62dac)"), the content's counts and one line per item
  (kind, key, digest), so an operator can compare imports.
- The log gains a `content` line per player that joins (callsign, build,
  importer, and the items it lacks or has differently) and `gaps` when the
  gaps change ([log lines](DEDICATED-SERVER.md)).
- A server's mission file is never refused for a gap; a player who cannot
  fly it is unable, with the words above, and the log says so as today.

### Mods, later

Nothing here builds a mod system. The design leaves room for one:

- Items are named by kind and key, so a mod's added aircraft is a new item
  that only players with the mod hold, and the gaps keep it out of the King's
  creator until everyone has it.
- A mod that changes a file changes the digest of every item that reads it;
  those items are "different" and not offered. The words say "differs".
- A mod that needs code is another T.O.R.E build, which the build rule keeps
  apart, as today.

### Interplay with other stages

- **Host migration (stage K).** The gaps are relative to the host's import. A
  standby that takes over has played the same mission, so the mission's items
  match; its other items may not. *Agent proposal:* each client sends its
  Content again to the new host at its reconnect, as at a join, and the new
  host sends new gaps; nothing goes into the checkpoint.
- **The Internet Lobby and discovery.** Unchanged: another T.O.R.E build is
  dimmed and named; a game whose mission a player lacks content for is
  joined and explained in its lobby, never refused at the door.
- **The data link (stage G)** and **phase 2 (stage F)** add no content kinds.

### Cost

*Agent proposals, measured by L1 (2026-10-05):* computing the content with
real data takes under 1 second in a release build on the development machine
(Ryzen 9 7900X), off the main thread. **Measured: 0.23 seconds in a release
build** (three runs, 0.231 to 0.233 s, one thread, the 1.02F import: 14
aircraft, 16 theaters under six conditions each, 131 weapons and the shared
item), and 2.4 to 3.1 seconds in a debug build, which is why the test that
holds it to one second applies in release builds only. So the probes run on one
thread, with no workers and **no copy on disk**: the content is computed once
for each import, as the joining section says. Items are independent, so the
probes may run on the shared workers (`tore-workers`) if a later import grows
far past this. The Content message is about 3 KB for 14 aircraft, 16 theaters
and about 135 weapons, a dozen reliable fragments once per join; the gaps are a
few bytes in the usual case.

### Testing and the full suite

Minimal, targeted and tracked, as John asked on 2026-10-05:

- **Rust, in the normal suite:** the items and their digests over synthetic
  imports (an item present, missing, different; the shared item); the
  coverage rule over the synthetic missions; the source entry and the report
  fallback; the theater label from the mission's own grid; the wire's round
  trips, bounds and golden; the host's gaps, refusals and words, and the
  client's words, on the network simulator with synthetic imports.
- **Rust, ignored for the full run** (they need real data, `TORE_DATA_DIR`):
  the coverage rule with real data over every aircraft once, every theater
  once and every weather condition once; the content's cost; and the two
  builds compared: a 1.0 import and a 1.02F import (`TORE_DATA_DIR_10` names
  the second) have the same digest for every item.
- **Battery, `net` lane:** `net-content-builds` (a server on the 1.02F import
  and a bot on a 1.0 import the scenario makes; the bot reads that every item
  is the same and flies) and `net-content-missing` (a bot whose import lacks
  `SU27.PT` joins the guide's mission and is unable with the words, another
  flies, the server's log names the gap).
- **Headless screen tests** in `tore-app` for the creator's dimming and
  notice, Load Ordnance's refusal, the hint and the Messages lines.

### Single player

No change. The import writes one more entry that nothing in single player
reads. The terrain's label comes from the mission's own grid, which gives the
same label; the slice that changes it (L1) runs the full single-player
baseline once and expects SAME. The creator and Load Ordnance change only in
lobby mode.

### How stage L lands

Four slices on `mp/l-<topic>` branches. L1 and L2 run at the same time; L3
needs both; L4 needs L3, and the lobby screen's phase 2 panels (slice F2-L)
merged first, since both edit `lobby_screen/`. The lead gave L2 protocol
10 and message kinds 37 and 38.

| Slice | Model | After | Owns | Work | Acceptance | Single player |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Content and source | Sonnet | none | `crates/tore-world/src/content.rs` and `content_tests.rs` (new), `resources.rs`, `terrain.rs` (the label only), `lib.rs` (the `mod` line); `crates/tore-import/src/source.rs` (new), `import.rs`, `lib.rs`; rules in `tools/battery_selection.py` for the new files; this section | [Content items](#content-items): `tore_world::content::Content::of(&resources)` with each item's kind, key, names and digest, probed through `ResourceReads`; the shared item's reference build; `ResourceSource::theater_label`, used by `Terrain::build`; `TORE_SOURCE_V1` written by the import; `tore_import::source::Source::read` with the report fallback; the cost measured, and the disk copy if it is over 1 second | Synthetic: an item present, missing and different gives the right digests; the shared item; the coverage rule over every synthetic mission; a manifest holds only its own grid and the label is unchanged; the source entry round trips, an old pack reads its build from the report, and a pack with neither reads as unknown. Ignored with real data: the coverage rule over every aircraft, theater and condition once; the cost; the 1.0 and 1.02F imports equal item for item | SAME (quick guard per change; the full baseline once) **Built (L1, 2026-10-05):** `tore_world::content::Content::of(&resources)` gives the items: a `Kind` (Aircraft, Theater, Weapon, Shared), a key, the resources the item reads as a `Manifest` and its digest (`Manifest::digest`). `get`, `shared`, `of_kind` and `holding(name)` (the items that read a file, which L3 uses to attribute a differing name) read it; `Item::new` and `Content::from_items` build items from decoded digests. The probes run each item's own loader through a `ResourceReads`: an aircraft is `AircraftType::load` then the standard `Loadout::new` (the profile, sensors, jammer, default stores' weapons and tanks, and the damage-look shapes the signature loader reads); a theater is `Terrain::for_mission` under all six conditions through one view, so it holds its layout, its own grid, the six layers, the placed objects and their shapes; a weapon is its `.JT` record, for every record not starting with `~` that `Weapon::parse` takes (what Load Ordnance offers); the shared item is the reference build less the aircraft's and the theater's names. The reference is an open mission (`Seating::Open`, as a host builds it) of the first aircraft and theater the import has, a flight of one on each side at 40,000 feet. An aircraft or theater whose loader fails is left out, and with none of either there is no reference build and no shared item. `Faxx` is its own item with `F22N.PT`'s names and digest. The coverage rule is a test: every mission it builds has its whole manifest inside the shared item and its own items, and the shared item inside its manifest. **What the real import showed:** the shared item is 299 radio phrase recordings and nothing else (the combat effects and the creator and cloud tables the design listed are not read by a mission build), and the first run of the rule over 16 real missions (every aircraft, theater and condition once, the 1.02F import) needed no probe moved; a 1.0 and a 1.02F import give the same digest for every item. `ResourceSource::theater_label(code)` is the new read: a base theater's label is its grid's name, a `~` variant's its base's name and the variant, exactly what `theater_catalog` gave, from one grid; `Terrain::build` uses it, so a manifest holds its own grid and not sixteen and a bad grid of another theater fails no mission (the catalog function stays for its other callers). The source: `tore_import::source` writes `TORE_SOURCE_V1` (`tore-source 1`, `build 1.02F`, `tore <version> <commit>`) from `import.rs`; `Source::read(data_dir, &resources)` gives the pack's entry, else the build from the report's `FA.EXE:` line with the importer unknown, else unknown; `Source::describe()` is the operator's line; `Importer::this_build()` is what L3 compares an older import with. Tests: 12 in `content_tests.rs` and 8 in `source.rs` on synthetic data; ignored for the full run: the three real-data content tests (coverage, cost, 1.0 against 1.02F) and `real_data_a_fresh_import_records_its_source`. *Agent decisions:* (1) `crates/tore-import/build.rs` is new (a copy of `tore-server/build.rs`): the importer's commit has to be compiled into the code that writes the pack, and the app's stamp is not visible to it; the version is `TORE_BUILD_VERSION` or the crate version, as the game's. (2) `Terrain::catalog` stays a public field and now holds the mission's own theater only (code and label); nothing read the rest. (3) A theater item needs the theater to build under all six conditions, since a mission may pick any. (4) The real-data tests read the pack with a 20-line reader of their own rather than add `tore-import` to `tore-world` as a dev-dependency. (5) No disk copy and no workers, from the measurement. (6) `TORE_SOURCE_V1` had to join the multiplayer pieces in the game's `is_multiplayer_resource` (`tore-app/src/assets.rs`, approved by the lead): left in `theater_resources` it changed the fingerprint of every combat tape, and the quick guard showed 8 differences until it moved. **For L4:** the game's `Assets` therefore holds the entry in `multiplayer_resources`, not in `theater_resources`; read the source with `Source::read(data_dir, &assets.multiplayer_resources)` (the entry is there; an older pack falls back to the report), and compute the content from `theater_resources`, which is what a mission is built from. Single player: SAME. The full baseline at `0e56b4a0` plus the `assets.rs` commit, against `m2r-g3a-assign2`: SAME 316, DIFFERENT 0, MISSING 0 (`.local/mp-baseline/m2r-l1-content`) |

The host fills every build as unknown and ignores a Content until L3 (a one-line stub in `host/mod.rs`, and the sample lobby's builds in `lobby_screen/preview.rs`, outside the row's files, which the lead approved). Agent decisions, listed [as built](formats/net-protocol.md#stage-l-as-built): a gap's players by lobby id, ascending, each once; a gap the host lacks has an empty label; every bound is refused by the writer, never cut; the largest Content gaps (about 175 KB) does not fit a message and the writer refuses it, so L3 keeps the gaps inside one.

Battery: `net-content-builds`, `net-content-missing` | SAME **Built (L3, 2026-10-05):** `tore_session::host::content` holds a game's content, `GameContent` (L1's items and the import's source: `of`, `read`, `with_source`, `shared`, `message`, `labels`), and the host's part: each connection's Content kept as a `PlayerContent`, the gaps (`gaps`, `gap_of`) among every connection whose Content has arrived and that is not closing, the Content gaps message kept inside one message (`message`), the words (`not_everyone`, `whose`, `unable_words`, `list`), the operator's report lines (`report_lines`) and the content log (`ContentLog`, `Host::poll_content_log`). `tore_session::client::content` holds the player's own words (`refusal`, `earlier_words`), the creator's refusal from the gaps (`gap_refusal`, also `Client::gap_refusal`), the Messages line about a build or items (`joined_line`) and the selected player's hint (`hint_line`). `HostConfig::content` and `ClientConfig::content` are `Option<Arc<GameContent>>`; `None` computes it from the resources given, with the source the pack's entry gives. The client sends its Content at Accepted and keeps the newest Content gaps (`Client::content_gaps`); the host finds the gaps again after a Content or a departure, sends them as the [protocol says](formats/net-protocol.md#stage-l-as-built), fills each player's build, refuses a Change mission whose aircraft or theater is in a gap and a Loadout whose weapon is (before anything is built), and words a Content refused in the third person; the client words its own by item. `tore-server --check` prints the source, the counts and one line per item, the server's log a start line and the `content` and `gaps` lines ([log](DEDICATED-SERVER.md#console-status-and-logs)); `tore-bot` has `--drop-resource`, `--content-report` and `--expect-unable` and prints the gaps and the build lines. Tests: `host/content_tests.rs` (13: five on the simulator, the acceptance above; eight on the gaps, the message's size, the words and the lines); three existing tests changed (two take the new words; one arms the King before the player whose weapon differs joins, since that loadout is now refused when chosen). Battery, net lane: `net-content-missing` (43 s) and `net-content-builds` (107 s, imports `gameassets/fighters-anthology/disc1`; every item of the 1.0 import equals the 1.02F one) pass. *Agent decisions:* (1) the content log is a queue of its own (`Host::poll_content_log`) rather than new `HostLog` variants, and the gaps' arrival is a `ClientEvent::Lobby` rather than a new event, so the game's exhaustive matches compile unchanged until L4 uses them; (2) when the gaps do not fit one message the host keeps the shared item, then aircraft, theaters and weapons, and its own refusals still see every gap; (3) a gap the host lacks names only the players that lack it too, and its words name the house in a game a player hosts ("Viper's game has no ...") and "the server" otherwise; (4) the third-person reason names the first kind the player lacks (aircraft, then theater, then weapons, joined by "or"), else the items it has differently, else the files ("in 3 files, such as CRATER.SH"), else "cannot build this mission"; (5) the player's own lacking line adds "Your import was made by an earlier T.O.R.E (0.1.2)." when its importer's version is lower than the game's or unknown, before the re-import hint; (6) an item whose loader fails for a missing file it reads (a default store's weapon, say) is lacked, so the words say the game "has no F/A-18D Hornet", as the design's rule that an item an import cannot load is left out; (7) the dedicated server adds the import report's build to the loaded resources as the source entry when an old pack has none (`prepare::add_source`), since the host is given resources, not the data folder; (8) `GameContent::shared` computes once for each set of resources while they live, so a host and clients given the same resources share one computation; (9) an importer string is cut to the wire's 64 bytes, an item whose key the wire cannot carry is left out, and a game with no item at all sends no Content; (10) `tore-bot --expect-unable`, not in the row, gives `net-content-missing` its pass condition. **For L4:** pass `GameContent::with_source(&assets.theater_resources, Source::read(data_dir, &assets.multiplayer_resources))` to both configs (until then a joining game computes its content at connect, 0.23 s in a release build, about 3 s in a debug one); read `Host::poll_content_log` in the hosting game's log; the lobby screen's hint now prefixes "X cannot play this mission: " to an `unable` text that already starts with the callsign ("Hawk's game has no ..."), so it should show the host's reason as it is.

No windowed run is required; the lead may add one to the full run | SAME (creator and Load Ordnance change in lobby mode only) **Built (L4, 2026-10-05):** *(L5, 2026-10-06, removed the build from the lobby: where this says the selected player's line has the build, `BuildNotes`, `BUILD_GRACE` or `lobby-builds`, read the L5 row below: the line is "Hawk: on Linux.", the note is `GapNotes` and says only items, with no grace, and the state is `lobby-gaps`.)* the game works out its content on a worker thread when Direct Connection or the Internet Lobby first opens (`net::session::start_content`, called from `open_direct` and `open_internet`), from `GameContent::with_source` over the import's theater resources and the source the start-up read (`net::session::remember_source`, called with the multiplayer resources beside the quick messages, and again after a Re-import media). `NetSession::start` and `begin_hosting` take it through `game_content`, which waits for the worker when it is still at work and works it out in place when no screen asked (a game joined from the command line), and hand it to `ClientConfig::content` and `HostConfig::content`, so the game, its host and its client share one computation. The hosting game's log gains the host's `content` and `gaps` lines (`Report::Content`, from `Host::poll_content_log`, as "Host: tick 3: content Bot: ..."). **The creator** (lobby mode only): `QuickMission::set_gaps` asks `Client::gap_refusal` about every aircraft and base theater it lists each frame the page is open; the aircraft lists (the six aircraft fields) and the theater list draw a row in a gap in a grey tint, choosing one (OK in the list, the shifted click, the right click back) leaves the draft as it was, closes the list and puts the host's words in the notice ("Not everyone can fly the Rafale C: Hawk's game has no Rafale C."), and Accept (`lobby_problem`) checks the whole mission the same way before anything is sent: the player's aircraft, each wing that flies (a wing with no aircraft is not counted, as the host does not count it) and the theater. **Load Ordnance** (lobby mode only): `Ordnance::set_gaps` asks about every weapon record; the catalog darkens a card in a gap to two fifths, picking it, dragging it onto a station or clicking a station with it picked says the host's words and loads nothing, and Accept (`accept_loadout`) refuses a loadout that already holds one. **The lobby:** the selected player's line is `hint_line` and how it connected ("Hawk: Fighters Anthology 1.0, on Linux. Connected directly (punched through)."; "Runs this game." for the house); an unable player's reason, the host's words, is said as it is in the line, in Messages and in the hint (the old "Hawk cannot play this mission: " prefix is gone, since the words start with the callsign), and the player's own screen says its own second-person words as they are, once; `facts::BuildNotes` puts `joined_line` in Messages once for each player, as soon as a gap names it or two seconds after the lobby first showed it (the build arrives in the lobby state and the gaps in a message of their own, so a player is not judged before both can have), for the joiner itself in the second person. Single player's creator and page never ask for gaps (their `lobby` flag is off), and the full baseline is not needed: no simulation or single-player code changed. Tests: `quick_mission` (3: a choice in a gap is refused through the list, the shifted click and the right click with the notice, Accept checks the player's aircraft, a wing that flies, an empty wing and the theater, and single player never asks), `ordnance` (2: the drag, the picked card and the station click refuse and single player's page is untouched; the dimmed card changes only its own pixels), `lobby_screen::tests` (4: the selected line, `BuildNotes` for a different build, a gap, a different item and an unknown build, a leaving and returning player, and the screen's lines and the host's reason as it is; three older tests take the new words), `net::session::tests` (the content is worked out once for each import), `net::hosting::tests` (2: the content lines reach the game's reports and log, and a given content is the host's); the menus lane gains the snapshot states `menus-snap-lobby-builds` and, in Quick Mission mode, `lobby-creator-gaps`, `lobby-creator-gap-notice`, `lobby-creator-gap-theaters` and `lobby-ordnance-gaps`, and the net lane the windowed scenario `net-window-gaps`. *Agent decisions:* (1) beyond the row's files, `lobby_screen/app.rs` (the gaps reach the pages each frame and Accept checks a loadout), `lobby_screen/preview.rs` (the `lobby-builds` state), `direct_screen/app.rs` and `internet_screen/app.rs` (one line each, the worker's start), `main.rs` (one line for the source and one name in the ordnance preview's list), `net/hosting_tests.rs`, `tools/battery_scenarios/menus.py` and `net_lobby.py`, and `docs/formats/menu.md`, `docs/testing/lane-net.md` and `docs/features.md`; (2) a dimmed row is a tint (104, 110, 112) over the creator's list, readable but plainly not the live rows; the weapon card is darkened rather than tinted because its art is a picture; (3) the creator closes its list on a refused choice so the notice, which the list would cover, is read; (4) the build line waits two seconds (`BUILD_GRACE`) for a player no gap names, an agent choice, because the build and the gaps arrive separately and a line said early would be wrong for a player who then turns out to lack something; (5) the selected player's line keeps how the player connected after the build, since J6's line was already there; (6) the worker is one thread started at most once for each import and joined when a session needs it, so a join that comes before it ends waits for the rest of it (under a second in a release build) instead of working it out again. |

## Host migration and rejoin

Design for stage K of the [multiplayer plan](multiplayer-plan.md#stages),
written on 2026-10-05 by a design agent for the lead, from a survey of the
`multiplayer` branch at `d7244b0c`. Not built and not yet reviewed by John.
John's decisions bind it (the guide's [decisions](MULTIPLAYER.md#decisions)):
migration is exact; the host is calculated or pinned by the King; a relayed
peer is never the calculated host; a dropped player's aircraft stays reserved
for them while it is alive, and otherwise they observe until the round ends; a
rejoin token is specific to one server and lasts 24 hours. Every other choice
is an *agent proposal*. The specs that go with it:

- the bytes: [net-protocol.md, host migration and rejoin](formats/net-protocol.md#host-migration-and-rejoin-stage-k);
- the master: [master-protocol.md, moving a listing](formats/master-protocol.md#moving-a-listing-stage-k);
- what players see: the guide's [host selection](MULTIPLAYER.md#host-selection),
  [host migration](MULTIPLAYER.md#host-migration) and
  [rejoin](MULTIPLAYER.md#rejoin-and-observers).

In short:

- **Only a game a player hosts migrates.** A dedicated server never does: it
  is the host by its operator's choice, and when it stops the game ends, as
  today. Its players still get rejoin tokens.
- **Up to two standbys.** The host picks the best one or two other players'
  games as standby hosts and streams them the mission: its start or a
  checkpoint, then every tick's inputs and every other change the host makes
  to its world, all through one door, the **journal**, so a standby's copy is
  the host's bit for bit. A standby on the same system and processor type
  steps its copy along (**warm**); any other keeps the newest checkpoint and
  the journal since (**cold**).
- **The session moves too.** Players, slots, the King's settings, the crown,
  scores, lives, reservations, tokens, the listing and the relay channels
  travel in the same stream as coded **state parts**.
- **Losing the host.** After 1.5 seconds without a packet from the host, the
  first standby takes over on the socket it already joined with, and every
  client races its addresses and **resumes**: the same session and plane, its
  own aircraft predicted throughout, its inputs since the standby's last tick
  sent again. The new host steps from that tick to the present with them and
  the mission goes on. Target: snapshots again within 5 seconds of the loss,
  typically 2 to 3.
- **Rejoin.** Every player gets a 128-bit token. A dropped player's aircraft
  goes to the AI, reserved for them while it is alive, and the token brings
  them back into it from whichever host now runs the session.
- **Host selection.** Players' games report their addresses, their system and
  a short CPU measure; the host measures who reaches whom, the round trips and
  the upload, and ranks candidates by upload, then round trip, then router,
  then CPU. The King can pin a host. A host too weak for its players is
  warned about, and in the lobby the game moves to a machine that can carry
  them.
- Single player does not change.

### What the survey found

At `d7244b0c`, line numbers indicative:

- **The host changes its world in five places.** `Host::tick` steps it with
  the tick's mission commands and seat inputs (`World::step_with`,
  `host/mod.rs`); scoring switches it on when a mission starts
  (`World::set_scoring`, `host/score.rs`) and drains its facts after every
  step (`take_score_facts`); the `ai-slot` revival cuts an AI aircraft's
  stores between ticks (`World::cut_ai_stores`, `host/revive.rs`); and the
  event tracker drains combat's device notes through `&mut World`
  (`Tracker::sort`, `host/sorting.rs`). A new mission replaces the world
  (`start_flying`, `next_mission`). Everything else only reads it, so all of
  it fits behind one door.
- **The session keys people by connection.** `Host::peers` is a
  `BTreeMap<ConnectionId, Peer>`; revivals hold seats and pending revivals by
  connection (`revive::Revivals::held`, `pending`), and scores note what each
  connection was last sent. Scores and lives are already kept by a player's
  join order (`lobby::Entry::order`), which no later connection reuses. A
  migration gives every player a new connection, so the join order becomes
  the player's identity.
- **What a host keeps beside the world**, each marked "for stage K" by the
  slice that built it: the settings store, the court (slot locks, sides by
  callsign), scoring, revivals (lives, held seats, side starts, spawned
  planes), the observers' delay rings, the lobby entries, the crown and the
  house, the mission's number and texts. The listing's token and the relay
  channels live outside `Host`, in the hosting thread's `HostListing`
  (`tore-net`, `master/rendezvous.rs`).
- **The house's leaving ends the game** (`Host::closed`, `host_left`), and
  nothing reconnects: a client whose host goes silent closes after the
  transport's 5 seconds. A game joined by address binds one address family on
  a port the system picks (`Join::to`, `net/session.rs`); a join through the
  master binds a dual-stack `ServerSocket`.
- **The client keeps 2 seconds of inputs** (`prediction::HISTORY_TICKS`, 240),
  and Accepted already carries a session id, drawn once per host
  (`host::session_id`).
- **The master pins a relay channel to an address.** A listing moves to a new
  address when a Heartbeat or Keep with its token arrives from one, at most
  once a minute (`tore-master`, `master.rs`), but its channels keep the old
  host address (`relay.rs`, `Channel::host`).
- **Randomness.** Every secret today is a fresh `RandomState`'s SipHash of a
  counter (`tore-net`, `entropy.rs`). The standard library draws those keys
  from the operating system's random source, so the values cannot be
  predicted without them.
- **Checkpoints are ready** ([exact checkpoints](#exact-checkpoints)): written
  in 1 to 8 ms, restored in 2 to 9 ms over a world built fresh in 40 to 80 ms,
  up to 1.0 MB in a 15 against 15 furball, and re-stepping costs what the
  ticks cost: 0.3 to 6 seconds for 10 seconds of mission
  ([baseline](baselines/checkpoint-2026-10-05.md)).

### Roles

| Role | Who | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | The game that runs the mission: the house, or the game it moved to | Runs the mission, chooses its standbys and streams them the mission and the session |
| Standby | Up to two other players' games, ranked by [host selection](#host-selection) | Holds the mission and the session; the first takes over when the host is lost |
| Player | Every connection, the standbys included | Reports its addresses and what it can do, keeps 10 seconds of its inputs, resumes with whichever host takes over |
| Dedicated server | `tore-server` | Never migrates and appoints no standby; issues tokens and holds reservations |

Standbys are players too: they fly, and their games draw the mission like any
other client's.

### The journal: one door into the world

Every change the host makes to its `World` goes through one type,
`host::journal::Driver`, which owns the world, lets the rest of the host read
it (`Deref<Target = World>`), and records each change as it makes it. Nothing
else in the host holds `&mut World`.

| Record | When | Applied as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flight | A mission starts flying (`start_flying`), and each next one | `World::new(spec, resources, Seating::Open)` from the flight's spec text, which every player already holds |
| Tick | Every tick | The changes before the step (the scoring switch, an `ai-slot` revival's store cut), `World::step_with` with the tick's mission commands and seat inputs, then the drains every tick makes (score facts, device notes) |
| Ended | The mission ends | The world is dropped |

A tick is one function, `tore_session::journal::apply_tick(world, &tick, out)`,
which the host calls to step and a standby calls to replay, so the two cannot
drift. The drains follow it: the host uses the score facts for its tallies
and the device notes for its events; a standby discards them or feeds its own
tracker. *Agent decision (K0):* the drains are `journal::drain`, apart from
`apply_tick`. *As built (K1):* the driver drains right after each step, as a
standby does, and hands the device notes to the event tracker as an argument
and the score facts to scoring (`Driver::take_facts`). *Agent decision (K1):*
a change before the step (the scoring switch, a store cut) is checked when
the host makes it, with the world's own refusals, but made only by the next
step's `apply_tick`, so a checkpoint taken between two ticks never holds a
change the next tick's record makes again. Each seat's input is recorded as the host stepped it: the
quantized controls, the commands in order, the view for lag compensation, and
the number of the last command applied. Mission commands (Take, GiveBack,
Abandon, Revive with its spawn) are recorded as given.

The journal's coders use the [checkpoint trait](formats/checkpoint.md#coding-rules)
(`tore_sim::checkpoint::Checkpoint`), so every field is named: a field added to
`SeatInput`, `SeatCommand`, `SeatView` or `Spawn`, or a variant added to
`MissionCommand`, fails to compile until the journal codes it. Each seat's
input is coded against the same seat's previous recorded input, across
records (the stream is ordered and reliable), so an unchanged control costs a
bit. *Estimate:* 2 to 5 bytes a seat a tick, about 1 to 4 KB/s with four to
eight humans and about 15 KB/s with 30. *Measured (K3):* 13 to 23 bytes a
seat a tick with sticks that move, about 50 KB/s with 30 humans, under
protocol 13; *as built (K3, protocol 14)* the controls go as the Inputs
section codes them, the command lists behind a presence bit, the view as
Inputs codes it and the command number as a bit when unchanged: 3.4 to 5.6
bytes a seat a tick, about 12.4 KB/s with 30 humans
([baseline](baselines/standby-stream-2026-10-05.md)).

This settles the two orderings the [checkpoint format](formats/checkpoint.md#restoring)
leaves to stage K: the host takes a checkpoint between ticks, after the
drains, and a standby turns scoring on only by replaying the record that did,
never by calling `World::set_scoring` itself.

### What moves with the host

| What | How it travels | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The world | A Flight record or a checkpoint, then the journal | Everything in the [checkpoint](formats/checkpoint.md#what-it-holds-and-what-it-leaves-out); bit for bit on one class |
| Players | State part *players* | By join order: callsign, lobby id, platform, path, the address the host sees, lobby entry (slot, loadout, ready, unable), stage, King, house, seat and plane, goodbye, whether it watches, its content (stage L). Away is F2-A's table, which travels in the rejoin part (K5) |
| The session | State part *session* | The session id; the settings store with the name and password; the lobby's and the flight's mission texts and number; the phase and its timers; whether anyone flew and since when nobody has; the join counter, the next lobby id and the planes going back at the next tick; last, the host's clock reading (for token expiry and to move the timers onto the new host's clock). The flying clock is not moved: the journal's tick is the mission's time |
| The court | State part *court* | Slot locks, sides by callsign |
| Scores | State part *scores* | Tallies by player and side, who last flew each plane. What each connection was last sent is not moved: the new host sends Scores to everyone at once |
| Revivals | State part *revivals* | Lives and losses by player; seats held for players whose plane is lost, and revivals asked for, both by player rather than connection; side starts; spawned planes |
| Rejoin | State part *rejoin* | Tokens with their expiry, and reservations ([rejoin](#rejoin-tokens-and-reservations)) |
| Host selection | State part *candidates* | Each player's report and measurements, the address the host sees it at, and the pinned host, so the new host punches every player and appoints standbys at once |
| Listing | State part *listing*, opaque to `Host` | The master's address, the listing id and token, the relay channels and their keys. The hosting thread hands it to its `Host` whenever it changes; the new hosting thread resumes its listing from it ([reaching the new host](#reaching-the-new-host)). *Built (K7a):* `Host::set_listing_part` keeps the bytes opaque, the journal sends them as the eighth part (empty for a game not listed), and `Host::resume` restores them for `Host::listing_part` |

**Not moved:** the observers' delay rings (8 MB at a minute's delay: a delayed
observer's stream starts again and waits out its delay), the connections' wire
state (every player starts a new [flight](formats/net-protocol.md#flights)),
chat and request rates, the tick-cost figures and the logs, and the event
tracker, which the new host builds from its world: a gun burst already firing
at the takeover gets no closing event, and clients drop open bursts with their
old flight.

**Coding.** Each part is coded whole with the checkpoint trait and its macros,
in a child module beside the state it codes (`host/king_state.rs` beside
`king.rs`, as stage H's `*_checkpoint.rs` files sit beside theirs), so a field
added to the court, the scores or the revivals fails to compile until it is
coded or skipped with its class. Connection ids belong to one host and are
coded as join orders. A part goes into the stream right after the tick in
which it changed, never later, so the parts a standby holds always match the
tick its journal has reached. Sizes: a few hundred bytes to a few KB each; the
players part is the largest with every loadout (about 64 bytes a player, up to
1.3 KB for one 64-station cheat loadout).

### Standbys

**Appointing.** The host keeps up to two standbys, the two best
[candidates](#host-selection) other than itself. A standby is replaced only
when it leaves or stops being eligible, never for a slightly better score,
since a new standby mid-flight costs a checkpoint. The host sends Appoint,
then the world: nothing in the lobby (it has no world to carry), the Flight
record when a mission starts, a checkpoint when a standby is appointed in
flight. A standby is **ready** once it holds a world at a tick the journal
continues from. Every player is sent the ready standbys and their addresses
(the **succession**).

**The stream** is one ordered, reliable stream of
[standby records](formats/net-protocol.md#the-standby-stream) on the standby's
own connection: Appoint, Dismiss, Flight, Checkpoint begin and chunks, Ticks
(a snapshot interval of journal ticks, sent with the snapshots), State,
Check, Ended and Handover. Order is what keeps it simple: any prefix of the
stream a standby holds is consistent.

**Warm and cold.** A standby whose **class** (the platform codes and the
processor architecture) matches the host's is **warm**: a thread of its game
steps its copy with each Ticks record as it arrives, a few ticks behind the
host, and costs what hosting costs (1.2 to 3.4 ms a tick for 30 aircraft on
the development machine, 15 to 40 percent of one core). Any other standby is
**cold**: it keeps the newest checkpoint and the journal since, and steps
them only when it takes over. A warm standby that falls 2 seconds behind (a
slow machine, a long frame) drops its copy and is cold until its next
checkpoint (*as built, K2:* it keeps its own checkpoint as a cold base, and
falls only after losing 2 seconds more while catching up).

| | Warm | Cold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Receives | The Flight record or one checkpoint, then the journal and the parts | The journal and the parts, and a checkpoint every 10 seconds (1,200 ticks, the plan's setting) |
| Checked by | A Check every 5 seconds (600 ticks): an FNV-1a 64 hash of the host's checkpoint at that tick, which the standby compares with its own at the same tick. A mismatch is logged and asks for a checkpoint; the standby is not ready until it arrives (*agent decision, K2:* what this machine stepped would differ the same way) | Each checkpoint's CRC-32 |
| Takes over | At once: its world is at the last tick it received | After a restore (2 to 9 ms) and the journal since the checkpoint (0.3 to 6 seconds for 10 seconds of mission) |
| Host upload | The journal and the parts, a few KB/s (*measured, K3, protocol 14:* 1.5 KB/s with three humans, 2.3 KB/s with four, 12.8 KB/s with 30); a checkpoint only when appointed in flight or after a mismatch | The same, plus 6 to 100 KB/s of checkpoints ([measured](baselines/checkpoint-2026-10-05.md)); the whole stream within 1 Mbit/s |

The check costs the host one checkpoint every 5 seconds (1 to 8 ms). It is
also the proof that two machines of one class really compute alike: if they
do not (a system library taking another instruction path, say), the checks
find it within 5 seconds and the standby carries on cold.

**Pacing.** A checkpoint goes in chunks of 4 KB, at most four unacknowledged
at once, so the standby's own reliable messages (its lobby, names and chat,
which share the ordered channel) never wait behind more than 16 KB. The rate
is the checkpoint's size over 8 seconds, at least 32 KB/s and at most 128
KB/s (1 Mbit/s) per standby, so the furball's 1.0 MB fits the 10-second
cadence. A cold checkpoint still going out when the next is due delays the
next; a checkpoint is never dropped half-sent. Ticks and State records are
never paced.

**Status.** At most twice a second a standby reports the newest tick it
holds, whether it is ready, warm or cold, its mean step cost, the last check's
result and whether it needs a checkpoint. The host's log and status line show
each standby.

**On the standby's side** (`tore_session::standby`): a state machine that takes
the records in order, builds the fresh world (`World::new` from the flight's
spec, which it holds as a player from the Mission and Flight loadouts
messages), assembles and restores checkpoints, replays ticks with
`journal::apply_tick`, keeps the state parts by id, checks the hashes and
reports. A worker thread runs it, in the game and in `tore-bot`, never on the
frame loop. It keeps one fresh world built ahead (40 to 80 ms), so a restore
never waits for a build.

### Losing the host

  C->>S: Backlog: its inputs from T on
  S->>S: Steps from T to the present with them
  S->>C: Snapshots again
```

**Detection.** A host sends every player at least 10 packets a second from a
thread no window can hold, so 1.5 seconds of silence means the host, or the
network to it, is gone. A client that hears nothing from its host for 1.5
seconds keeps the connection open and races the succession; whichever answers
first wins: the old host (the race stops) or a new one. A client with no
ready standby waits out the transport's 5 seconds, as today, and its mission
ends with "The host left the game."

**Who takes over.** Standby 1, after 1.5 seconds without the host. Standby 2
waits 3 seconds more, racing standby 1 as a client meanwhile, and takes over
only if standby 1 has not answered, so a second host never starts beside a
live first. A standby that is not ready never takes over; it joins whoever
does.

**Taking over:**

1. The standby replays what it holds to its end, tick T (a cold one restores
   its checkpoint first).
2. It builds a `Host` with `Host::resume` from the world and the parts: the
   session's id and clock, the settings, court, scores, revivals, tokens,
   reservations and candidates; every player of the players part **absent**
   until it resumes; an event tracker built from the world; its own player as
   the house. Its game's client switches to the in-process link, and a
   hosting thread takes the socket the standby joined with
   ([reaching the new host](#reaching-the-new-host)).
3. It sends Taken over to the old host on the connection its client still
   holds, in case the old host is alive, and punches every player's addresses.
4. It holds its clock at T for the **resume window**: until every seated
   player has resumed, at most 1.5 seconds.
5. It steps from T to the **present** as fast as it can: each resumed seat
   with the inputs its backlog brought, each absent seat on its last recorded
   controls and then neutral by the
   [stall rule](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k). It sends no snapshot
   meanwhile; the first goes out at the present.
6. A player still absent 5 seconds after the takeover (the drop timeout) is
   dropped: its plane goes to the AI, reserved for it
   ([rejoin](#rejoin-tokens-and-reservations)).

**The present** is where the old host's clock would be now. The standby's own
client already estimates the host's newest tick from the snapshots' arrivals
(it draws by it) and carries it forward from the last one. The new host keeps
the old one's pace, so every client's clock and prediction stay where they
were.

**On the client** (`client::migrate`):

- Its own aircraft flies on throughout: prediction never stops. It keeps 10
  seconds (1,200 ticks) of its inputs and numbered commands for the backlog,
  beside the predictor's 2 seconds.
- It connects from the same socket, with its token in the Challenge answer,
  so the new host knows the player at the handshake and admits it even when
  full. Accepted must carry the session's id; any other ends the race for
  that address.
- **Resume** carries its newest predicted tick and the mission it holds.
  **Resumed** answers with the new flight, the seat and plane, tick T, the
  last command applied for it, and its plane's exact state at T. The client
  compares that with its own prediction at T: equal, the rule on one class,
  changes nothing; otherwise it restarts from it and steps its backlog again,
  as any correction.
- **Backlog** sends its inputs from T to its newest tick and the commands not
  yet applied, numbered afresh for the new flight.
- A new flight starts the wire state afresh (baselines, names, events) but
  keeps the prediction, the clocks and the other aircraft's histories: the
  others hold still through the gap and then jump to the present, as after a
  [stall](#a-stalled-game-stays-connected-ef-k).
- A player in the lobby resumes into the lobby, and an observer's watch starts
  again. The mission is built again only when its number or text differs.

**The old host.** A host that receives Taken over, or that loses every remote
player at once for 1.5 seconds while it had a ready standby, asks standby 1
whether it hosts now (a [Reach](formats/net-protocol.md#reach-and-reach-answer)
from the game port). Until it learns so it flies on, privately if it is cut
off, its own player included. Once a new host answers, its hosting thread
stops without a word to anyone, hands the socket back to its game, and the
game's client resumes with the new host like any other: "Your connection
dropped; the game moved to Hawk's machine." A network split that leaves two
halves alive is not healed: each half flies on with its AI (a known limit).

**Leaving on purpose.** When the house leaves, or the host moves in the lobby,
the host hands over instead of ending the game. It ends the leaving player's
flight as usual (the debrief, the plane to the AI), sends standby 1 a Handover
after its last tick and every player Host moving, and stops stepping. Standby
1 takes over at once and every client races it at once, so the gap is a round
trip or two and a few ticks of fast-forward. With no ready standby the house's
leaving ends the game as today, and the King reads beforehand "No other game
can take over hosting: if you leave, the game ends."

**The timeline**, with a warm standby (estimates; slices K4 and K10 measure
them):

| Step | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Detection | 1.5 s |
| Takeover: replay to its end, build the host, hand over the socket | under 0.1 s warm; cold, a restore and up to 10 s of journal: 0.3 to 6 s |
| Every client connects (it has raced every 250 ms since the 1.5 s) and resumes | 2 to 3 round trips |
| Fast-forward from T to the present | about 2 s of ticks at 1 to 5 ms each: 0.2 to 1 s |
| **Snapshots again** | **about 2 to 3 s after the loss with a warm standby** |

A cold standby in a furball can pass 5 seconds; that is why warm is the
default wherever the class allows it.

### Reaching the new host

**The socket a game joined with is its future host socket.** Its router
already maps it, the host and the master have seen it, and players can punch
to it as to any host. From stage K every joined game binds a dual-stack
`ServerSocket` on the game port (26900, or the setting) when that port is
free, and on any port otherwise, as a join through the master already does.
On the game port, a game that takes over is also found by the local network's
search and by a friend typing its address.

- **A router in front of the joined socket** (`tore_net::peers`): datagrams
  from the current host go to the client; Reach packets go to the reach
  answerer (at most 10 a second from one address and port, 160 from one IP
  address, so a LAN party of 8 behind one router all become eligible, and 200
  in all; a hosting game's transport answers with the same limits); Connect requests, Discover queries and anything else are dropped
  until the game hosts, and go to its host's transport after.
- **Candidates.** Each game reports its socket's Local IPv4 and Global IPv6
  addresses, and a Mapped one when the player's "Forward the game port on my
  router" switch is on and it is a standby (it maps the port when appointed).
  The host adds the address it sees the game at. The succession lists them.
- **Reach tests.** The host sends a candidate every player's addresses and
  every player the candidate's (Reach peers, Reach test). The candidate sends
  each player address five
  [Reach](formats/net-protocol.md#reach-and-reach-answer) packets 200 ms apart,
  which open its router to them; each player sends Reach to the candidate's
  addresses from its joined socket, and the answers give each pair's round
  trip. Each player reports to the host which address answered and the median
  round trip. The rows of the [punching table](#hole-punching) that punch get
  through; a candidate some player cannot reach is not eligible.
- **At the takeover** the new host punches every player's addresses again, and
  each client races every address in the succession and any a Reach taught
  it.
- **Relayed players** cannot be reached directly. In a listed game the new
  hosting thread resumes the listing from the listing part and heartbeats from
  its own socket with the listing's token, which moves the listing and, from
  stage K, its relay channels with it
  ([master](formats/master-protocol.md#moving-a-listing-stage-k)). A relayed
  player's game keeps its channel when its host is lost and connects again to
  the same relayed address; the master forwards to the new host, which knows
  the channel's key from the part. A game that is not listed has no relayed
  players.
- **The listing** moves the same way, so the Internet Lobby keeps one entry
  and an introduction reaches the new host within a heartbeat. *Known limit:*
  the master moves a listing at most once a minute, so a second migration
  within the minute leaves it at the dead address until the minute is up.

### Host selection

**What each game reports** (Candidate, in the lobby and whenever it changes):
whether it may host (the Options switch "Let my game take over hosting", on by
default), its class, its candidates, its router's mapping type when it ran the
master's [mapping test](formats/master-protocol.md#mapping-test), and a **CPU
measure**: on a thread of its own it builds the lobby's mission once more and
steps that throwaway copy for 240 ticks (2 seconds of mission, all AI), and
reports the mean cost of a tick.

**What the host measures:**

- **Reach and round trips**, by the reach tests above, for the three best
  candidates by the other measures, again when a player joins, and at most one
  test every 10 seconds.
- **Upload**, in the lobby only: the host asks the three best candidates, one
  at a time, for a 1-second paced burst at the rate the game needs (Upload
  test: Payload packets with a Filler section, under 1,200 bytes each). The
  need is 28 KB/s for every other player at 30 snapshots a second (the
  stage D peak per player, [measured](baselines/net-2026-09-30.md)), scaled
  by the game's snapshot rate: 56 KB/s at the default 60 (slice D12, an
  agent decision; [measured](baselines/net-rates-2026-10-06.md)) and, for each standby, what its
  stream needs: a warm one 3 KB/s and 0.52 KB/s for each human flying, a cold
  one that and 80 KB/s of checkpoints
  ([fitted in slice KP](baselines/host-selection-2026-10-05.md#the-upload-need-follows-the-standby-streams-slice-kp)
  from [the stream's measurements](baselines/standby-stream-2026-10-05.md)). A
  candidate **passes** when 90 percent of it arrives. A player who joined in
  flight has no upload figure and ranks below those that have one.

**Eligible:** not relayed (John, 2026-09-28); reached by every other
non-relayed player; its switch on; in a game a player hosts. **Ranked** in the
guide's order, with *agent proposal* steps so that small differences do not
decide: upload (a pass before a fail), then the median round trip to the
other players in 20 ms steps, then the router (no translation or a mapped
port; one outside port for every destination; a new one for each; unknown),
then CPU in 0.5 ms steps, then the longest-connected. The host ranks itself
the same way from its own figures. *As built (K6), agent decision:* a game
cannot test its own upload in the lobby without a wire change, so the house
passes until its flights say otherwise: the share of its packets the median
direct player's game acknowledges, over its last ten seconds of flight.

**The pinned host.** The King's new setting 21, `host`: `calculated` (the
default) or a player. A pin moves the host in the lobby at once, by a
handover; a pin made in flight applies when the lobby returns. A pinned player
who leaves falls back to calculated, with a line. A relayed player cannot be
pinned: "Hawk connects through the relay and cannot host."

**Calculated, in the lobby.** The game stays on the machine it is on while
that machine passes. When it does not and another candidate does, the game
moves to the best passing one in the lobby, with a line in Messages: "The game
moved to Hawk's machine, which can carry 12 players." It never moves in flight
for a better score, only when its host is lost or leaves. *Built (KP):* the move
is one call to `Host::hand_over`. The player to move to (the pin, or the best
passing machine) first takes standby 1, changing places with it when it is
standby 2 or replacing it when it stands by for nobody, and the game is handed
over once that player is ready; with the standbys off, or the player not ready,
the decision waits.

**The warning.** The King reads it in Messages whenever the host, calculated
or pinned, does not pass: "No machine here passed the test for 12 players:
Hawk's carried 70 percent of what they need. Fewer players, or a dedicated
server, will fly better." The CPU warning follows the same rule, with a
threshold slice K6 fits from the measured 15 against 15 costs (the busiest
minute must stay under half of one core) and records in its baseline.
*Built (K6):* the first minute is the busiest, at 0.81 to 0.85 times the
measure, so a measure up to 4.9 ms a tick passes
([baseline](baselines/host-selection-2026-10-05.md)).

**No eligible host.** With no eligible candidate the host appoints no
standby, and the King reads "No other game can take over hosting: if you
leave, the game ends." This designs the guide's open question with its agent
proposal.

### Rejoin tokens and reservations

**Tokens.** At a player's first join the host draws a 128-bit token, two
draws from `tore_net::entropy` (the standard library's randomly keyed hasher,
keyed from the operating system's random source), and sends it in a Token
message. The game keeps it in its data folder (`rejoin-v1.conf`) with the
session id, the host's addresses, the succession's, the listing id if any,
and the callsign: at most 32 tokens, each dropped when it expires. No new
dependency is needed (John's open question on `getrandom`).

- **One server's.** A token is good only in the session that issued it,
  whichever host runs that session now. A dedicated server's session lasts as
  long as its process, so a restarted server knows no old token.
- **24 hours** (John, 2026-09-28), counted from when its player was last
  connected, on the session's clock, which moves with the host.
- **Sent** in the Challenge answer whenever the game knows it is joining that
  session: a migration's race; a game in Direct Connection's list or on the
  Internet Lobby whose session id matches (both show it); or the address the
  token came from. A game that joined by a typed address with no token and
  learns the session from Accepted sends it in a Rejoin message instead.
- **A kick voids** the player's token; leaving does not.

**Reservations.** When a seated player is **dropped** (silence, a crash,
quitting without ending the flight), its plane goes to the AI as today, but
**reserved** for that player while the plane is alive: nobody else takes it,
and its slot reads "AI (Viper away)". A player who **ends its flight** (End
Mission) frees the plane: a reservation is for someone who did not mean to
go. The idle-player rule ([F2-A](#the-ai-flies-an-idle-players-aircraft))
keeps its planes in the same table.

- **Rejoining** with a valid token, the player is that player again: its lobby
  id when free, its callsign, its join order (so its scores and lives are its
  own), its side under lock sides, and in flight its reserved plane, taken
  back by its Join at the next tick (a Seated, a new flight; *as built, K5:*
  the game's Join, once its mission is built). A reservation admits its
  player even when the game is full.
- **Lost while away.** A reserved plane that is lost ends the reservation. The
  player rejoins as one whose plane was lost: the
  [revival](#death-revival-and-lives) rules apply with the lives it had, and
  with none (co-op's default `none`, or no lives left) it watches until the
  mission ends, which is John's rule.
- **Release.** The King's "Release reserved aircraft" (the Players panel)
  frees a reservation; the player who comes back finds no plane and takes a
  free slot by the usual rules.
- **The end** of a mission clears every reservation; a player who rejoins in
  the lobby finds its slot and loadout, as the lobby keeps them.
- **Dedicated servers** do all of this the same way.

#### Rejoin tokens and reservations, as built (K5)

*Built (K5, 2026-10-05).* No wire change. Every choice below is an agent
decision unless the design above or John's decisions say it.

- **One table, by join order.** `host::rejoin::Rejoin` holds each player's
  record (token, callsign, lobby id, slot and loadout, when it was last
  connected, voided) and the reservations (`Reserved`: plane, lobby id,
  callsign, `returning`, `away`), both keyed by the player's join order, which
  no later connection reuses. F2-A's away reservation is the entry with
  `away` set (its game still connected, the lobby marks it away, Back takes
  the plane); a dropped player's has it clear. `Host::idle` keeps only the
  asked and flight counts. A mission with only away players is not empty; one
  with only dropped players is (their games are gone), so the empty timeout
  still ends it.
- **Tokens.** A token is drawn when a connection joins and sent in a Token
  message with the life of 86,400 seconds. A game's token that works is
  admitted by the gate whatever the room (`HostGate::tokens`); the password and
  the build are still checked. Moments are on the session's clock, the host's
  plus `Rejoin::offset`, which a host that takes over sets so the 24 hours do
  not start again (`Rejoin::carry_clock`, for slice K4). A record outlives its
  token by 7 days so an expired token is still told so; at most 1,024 records.
- **A token that does not work** is answered in words and the game joins as a
  new player: "Your rejoin token has expired: it lasts 24 hours after you were
  last in the game.", "You were removed from this game, so your rejoin token no
  longer works." (a kick), "This game does not know your rejoin token: it was
  issued by another game." Challenge-answer tokens get a Notice with "You
  join as a new player."; a Rejoin message gets the same words as its
  refusal, or "You are already in the game." from a game that flew or holds a
  slot.
- **A restarted game replaces its old connection.** A token whose player is
  still connected (the game restarted before the host's 5 seconds of silence)
  is admitted too: the old connection is dropped as a drop would (its plane
  reserved, its crown moved) and the new one becomes the player.
- **Drop, leave, kick.** A seated player whose connection ends by silence, a
  crash or a disconnect that did not end its flight is dropped: its plane
  goes to the AI at the next tick and is reserved (the log says "Viper dropped
  out: the AI flies plane 0, kept for it"). Leave (End Mission in the game),
  a kick, the host leaving and the mission's end keep nothing. An away player
  whose game says goodbye (disconnect Left) has left on purpose and frees its
  plane; its silence or crash keeps it. A kick voids the token.
- **Coming back.** The new connection is the player: its join order, callsign
  and lobby id when free, in the lobby its slot and loadout when the slot is
  still free, and "Welcome back, Viper: your aircraft is waiting." The plane is
  taken by the player's Join (the game's automatic ready sends it once its
  mission is built), at the next tick as a new flight, not by the host on its
  own: a Seated message before the game has built the mission would find
  nothing to seat. The King's rules on taking a plane do not apply, as for
  Back. A reserved aircraft is refused to anyone else "Plane 0 is kept for
  Viper, who is away."
- **A plane lost while away.** The reservation ends the tick the host sees
  the AI has lost it, connected or not, and the revival rules count from that
  tick: `revival.players[order].lost` holds the plane and the tick, so the
  delay, the lives and `respawn` apply when the player returns or is still
  here. The player is told with its Revival message. A return takes a free seat for the
  revival, since no seat held the wreck: `ai-slot` takes a free plane of its
  wing's side as before, and `revive` makes the new plane with the world's
  `MissionCommand::ReviveLost { seat, plane, spawn }`, which revives a seat
  with no plane from a lost plane that nobody holds (an AI aircraft the AI lost,
  or an abandoned wreck); the journal codes it as variant 5. A player who drops
  with its plane already lost keeps no reservation, only the lost record, and
  returns the same way.
- **Release.** The King's Release (message 53) frees the reservation on that
  plane ("No aircraft is kept for a player on that plane." if none); a player
  still connected is told.
- **Scores and lives follow the token.** A player's tally stays in the
  mission's scores while its token works; its lives are kept by join order as
  before.
- **The part.** `rejoin_state.rs` codes the records, the table (F2-A's away
  planes included) and the clock offset with the checkpoint trait (every field
  named); a record's token is two 64-bit halves. `host/state.rs` journals it
  as the sixth part (`Part::Rejoin`) and restores it with `load_rejoin`, then
  sets the offset so the session's clock goes on from the old host's reading.
  The journal's crowd fight drops and rejoins a bot, so the part, the
  reservation and the take go through the replay check.
- **The client** keeps the granted token with the session's id
  (`Client::token`, a `KeptToken`) and hands it to the game's `TokenStore` when
  granted and when the connection ends. `ClientConfig::token` is sent in the
  Challenge answer; `Client::rejoin(token)` sends a Rejoin. `FileStore` is a
  one-line file (`rejoin-v1 SESSION TOKEN LIFE LAST_SEEN CALLSIGN`) for bots
  and tests; the game's `rejoin-v1.conf` is slice K7b's (built: `net/rejoin_store.rs`).
- **`tore-bot --token-file FILE`** keeps and sends the bot's token; a bot killed
  in flight and started again with the same file is back in its plane.
- **Dedicated servers** do all of this the same way. Every `Host` test client
  now hears a Token message after it joins.

### What players see

- **During a migration**, on the HUD's message line: "Lost contact with the
  host. Moving the game to Hawk..." and then "The game moved to Hawk." The
  player's own aircraft flies on; the others hold still through the gap (2 to
  3 seconds) and then jump to where they are; missiles in flight fly on. If no
  host answers within 15 seconds: "No other game could take over. The host
  left the game.", and the debrief.
- **In the lobby** the house mark moves to the new host and Messages says the
  same line.
- **The debrief** is the world's: kills from before the migration count, and
  Results list every pilot, as before.
- **Rejoining:** "Welcome back, Viper: your aircraft is waiting." in Messages.
  Direct Connection and the Internet Lobby mark a game whose session the
  player holds a token for with "Rejoin".
- The **net log** gains `migrate` lines (host lost, racing, resumed with whom
  after how long) and the **host's log** standby, takeover, resume and rejoin
  lines.

### Captures, replays and telemetry

- **Captures** run again offline: the race, the new connection and the resume
  follow from the received datagrams and the clock, and the new connection's
  nonce from the capture's seed. If the replay cannot derive one of them,
  slice K4 adds a record for it and raises the capture's format.
- **Converted replays** (stage E) run through a migration: the plane is the
  same before and after, so the conversion continues across the Resumed
  flight.
- **Telemetry:** a report's migrations and failed migrations
  ([Report](formats/master-protocol.md#reports)) count the migrations the game
  resumed through and those it lost the session to.

### Single player

Nothing changes. The journal wraps only a host's world; single player steps
its `World` from the frame loop as before. No slice changes simulation code,
so each runs the quick single-player guard, and none needs the full baseline
unless it finds it must touch `tore-world` or `tore-sim` beyond the journal's
coders.

### How stage K lands

Slices, each on its own `mp/k-<topic>` branch and worktree, merged by the lead
with the quick check per change. "Opus" slices are networking, concurrency,
determinism or risky refactors (John's rule); the rest are Sonnet. Every slice
adds its tests to the full suite: Rust tests in its crates, a `net` lane
scenario for anything done through a binary (a driver in
`tools/battery_scenarios/net.py`, a family in `tools/battery_selection.py`),
slow tests `#[ignore]`d and listed in the "Network tests outside the battery"
table of `docs/testing/README.md`, and a rule in `tools/battery_selection.py`
for every new file. As in phase 2, each slice's tests go in files of their
own, never in `host/tests.rs`. K0 takes **the next protocol version** (13, as built) for
every wire change below; no later slice changes the wire without the lead.

| Slice | Model | After | Owns | Work | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K0 Wire and seams | Opus | | `tore-net`: `packet.rs` (Reach, Reach answer, the Challenge answer's token, disconnect reason 8), `server.rs` and `client.rs` (the token through `ConnectDetails` and `tore_net::ClientConfig`), `entropy.rs` (the token's draw); `tore-session`: `wire/{messages,mod}.rs`, `wire-golden.txt`, new `wire/migration_tests.rs`, new `journal.rs`, `settings.rs` (setting 21), new empty `host/{journal,standby,resume,rejoin,succession,state}.rs`, `standby/mod.rs` and `client/{migrate,rejoin,candidate}.rs`, the calls to them in `host/mod.rs` and `client/mod.rs`, the client's pass-through of standby records; `tore-world`: coders for `SeatInput`, `SeatCommand` and `SeatView` (`seats_checkpoint.rs`), `MissionCommand` and `Spawn` (new `world/commands_checkpoint.rs`) | Every packet, section, message, record and field of the [stage K wire](formats/net-protocol.md#host-migration-and-rejoin-stage-k) with its coding; `journal::Tick`, its coding and `apply_tick`, and the host stepping through `apply_tick` from the start, so there is one code path; a host's transport answering Reach for its own session (role 1); the hooks, and the empty fields on `Host` and `Client`, that each later slice fills (the journal's queue, the standbys, absent players, tokens and reservations, candidates, the migration's state), doing nothing yet; requests not built yet refused "Not available yet." | Round trip, fuzz and golden tests for every new packet, message and record; a world stepped by the host's path and a twin replaying the coded Ticks code to the same checkpoint bytes every 30 ticks for 1,200 ticks of the crowd fight; a field added to `SeatInput` fails to compile in its coder (by hand); every existing session test passes; quick check `--no-battery` **Built (K0, 2026-10-05):** protocol 13 (J6 took 12; 11 was never used), kinds 39 to 54 ([as built](formats/net-protocol.md#stage-k-as-built)). `tore-net`: `Reach`, `ReachAnswer` and `ReachRole` in `packet.rs`, the Challenge answer's `token` (`tore_net::Token`) through `ConnectDetails::token` and `ClientConfig::token`, `DisconnectReason::MovedToNewHost`, `TokenSource` in `entropy.rs`, and `Server::set_reach_session`, which answers a Reach for the host's own session 10 a second from one address. `tore-session`: the bodies in a new `wire/migration.rs` beside `messages.rs` (agent decision: as chat's are in `wire/chat.rs`), `SECTION_FILLER`, the lobby's `StandbyMark` and `LobbySlot::reserved`, setting 21 (`settings::number::HOST`, refused but for calculated until K6); `journal.rs` with `Tick`, `Change`, `apply_tick`, `drain`, `check_hash`, `Part`, the `Record`s and `StreamWriter`/`StreamReader`; the host builds each tick's `Tick` and steps through `apply_tick`, then hands it to `host/journal.rs`; the seams in `host/{standby,resume,rejoin,succession,state}.rs`, `standby/mod.rs` and `client/{migrate,rejoin,candidate}.rs`, each refusing its requests "Not available yet."; the client keeps standby records for `Client::take_standby_records`; `Host::reserved_for` fills a slot's reservation from F2-A's idle table, the seam K5 joins. `tore-world`: the coders in `seats_checkpoint.rs` and a new `world/commands_checkpoint.rs` (its `mod` line in `world/commands.rs`); `tore-sim`'s command types (combat's, the wing orders, the tower's) are coded variant by variant there, since the trait is `tore-sim`'s. *Agent decision:* `apply_tick` makes the changes and the step, and `journal::drain` the drains (score facts, device notes), which the host's scoring and tracker still make themselves until K1 passes the tracker its notes; a standby calls both. Beyond the row's files, each a line or two: `wire/inputs.rs` and `wire/connection.rs` (the Backlog reuses the Inputs frame coder; the host's section check takes Filler), `wire/samples.rs`, `wire/golden_tests.rs`, `settings_tests.rs` and `host/king_tests.rs` (setting 21 in the lists), `tore-net`'s `connection.rs`, `lib.rs` and fuzz test, and in `tore-app` the lobby preview's two new fields and the registry test leaving setting 21's row to K7b. Measured: a steady seat costs under 9 bytes a tick in the stream (its seat byte and command number included), a stick moving every tick about 24, above the design's 2 to 5; K3 measures the real stream. Tests: `wire/migration_tests.rs`, `journal_tests.rs` (the twin of a 4 against 4 fight, 1,200 ticks, equal checkpoints every 30), `client/migration_seams_tests.rs` (a real host's ticks replayed on a twin code to its checkpoint every 30 ticks; refusals; Reach; the records passed on; an away player's reserved slot), the coders' tests in `tore-world`, `tore-net`'s packet, server, client, entropy and fuzz tests, and the golden at version 13 |
| K1 Journal and session state | Opus | K0 | `host/journal.rs`, new `host/journal_tests.rs`, `host/state.rs`, new `host/{lobby,king,score,revive}_state.rs` and their `mod state` lines, the world's field and its uses in `host/mod.rs`, `host/sorting.rs` (the notes as an argument), one line each in `host/score.rs` and `host/revive.rs` | The `Driver`: the world behind it and read-only elsewhere; Flight, Tick (with its changes before the step) and Ended records out of it, into a queue the standby stream (K3) drains; the parts players, session, court, scores and revivals with their coders (connection ids coded as join orders) and a changed flag each | On the network simulator a host and three bots fly the crowd fight for 5 minutes with an `ai-slot` revival, scoring on and a late joiner: the journal replayed over the Flight record's world codes to the host's checkpoint bytes every 30 ticks, and so does a checkpoint at tick N with the journal from N; each part round-trips and restores into a fresh host's structures as equal; a field added to `Court` fails to compile (by hand); quick guard **Built (K1, 2026-10-05):** `host::journal::Driver` owns the world (`Host::world` is one); the host reads it through `Deref<Target = World>` and changes it only through the driver: `set_scoring` and `cut_ai_stores` (same names as the world's, so `score.rs` and `revive.rs` call them unchanged) record the change for the next step, `step` adds them to the tick, steps through `apply_tick` and drains at once, the device notes going to `Tracker::sort` as an argument and the score facts to `Driver::take_facts`. A store cut is checked when made with the world's own refusals (*agent decision*: made only by the step, see [the journal](#the-journal-one-door-into-the-world)). `build_world` returns a driver, so a lobby rebuild (`king.rs`) replaces it unchanged. `host::journal::Journal` queues `JournalRecord`s (Flight at `start_flying`, Tick after each step, State for each changed part, Ended at `end_mission`) for `Host::drain_journal`, only while `Host::record_journal(true)` (K3 turns it on with its first standby; nothing is kept otherwise), and at most 14,400 records: past it the queue is dropped and the next drain says so, so K3 starts its standbys again from a checkpoint (*agent decisions*). The parts: `host/state.rs` (session, the dispatch and the coding helpers), and children beside their state, `host/{lobby,king,score,revive}_state.rs` (each a `mod state` line). Every coder destructures its struct, `Host` and the connection record included, so a field added fails to compile until it is coded or skipped with its class (checked by hand on `Court`). *Agent decisions:* a part is sent when its coding's FNV-1a 64 changes, not by flags set at each call site; parts go out after each tick in flight and on each update otherwise, the lobby's parts before the Flight; a part's tick is the last tick stepped (0 before any); moments are coded on the host's clock and the session part ends with the clock's reading, outside its change hash, so a part does not change as time passes, and a restore moves each moment onto the new host's clock (`state::Clock`); the flying clock (`origin`, `ticks_run`) is not in a part (K4 keeps the old host's pace); a connection the host has forgotten entirely is left out of a part, and the journal remembers every connection's join order for the mission; the settings store restores through `Store::from_config` (its values are private to `settings.rs`), checked against the coded list; the players restore as `lobby::state::PlayerState`s, which K4 holds absent and turns into records with `PlayerState::into_peer` (watching again only when the player asks again, as net-protocol.md's resume says); F2-A's away table is left for K5's rejoin part. The restore side (`Host::restore_part`, `restore_players`, `session_clock`) and the drain wait for K3 and K4. Tests: `host/journal_tests.rs` (the crowd fight on the simulator with three bots, one ejecting and flying again in an AI aircraft by `ai-slot` with half its gun rounds, a late joiner, scoring on: the records through `StreamWriter` and `StreamReader` replayed over the Flight's world match the host's checkpoint every 30 ticks and at the end, and so do checkpoints at three ticks with the journal from each; every part restores into a fresh host and codes to the same bytes, mid-fight and at the end; 40 simulated seconds in the normal suite, about 19 s, and the five minutes `#[ignore]`d for the full run; the driver's deferred changes; the queue's bound and recording switch; the session part's settings past the King's lists and its timers on another clock), and a test of each part's coder with every field filled in `host/{lobby,king,score,revive}_state.rs` |
| K2 Standby replay | Opus | K0 | new `tore-session/src/standby/{mod,assemble,thread}.rs`, new `standby/tests.rs`, the `pub mod standby;` line | The `Standby` state machine and its worker thread, as [standbys](#standbys) describes: records in order, the fresh world and its spare, checkpoint assembly and restore, warm replay within a budget, cold mode, checks, the fall to cold, status, and handing its world and parts to a takeover | In-process, with records made by `journal::apply_tick` on the crowd fight: a warm standby equals its source at every check for 5 minutes; a cold one restored at ten moments and replayed to the end equals it; a damaged chunk is refused and asked for again; a standby starved of time goes cold and comes back warm; a mismatch injected by hand asks for a checkpoint; the thread stops cleanly **Built (K2, 2026-10-05):** `tore_session::standby`: `Standby`, the state machine (`receive` a record's bytes in order, `step` within a `Budget` of ticks or time, `prepare` the spare, `status` for message 47, `take_notes` for the net log, `replica` and `take_over`), `standby/assemble.rs` (a checkpoint's chunks, checked whole by the container's CRC-32, its tick and its mission identity; `cut`, the host's side, for K3) and `standby/thread.rs` (`StandbyThread`: records in, status and notes out, `take_over` and `stop`, a 20 ms stepping slice, the spare built when idle). The game supplies a `Builder` that builds the flight it holds as a player from a `MissionKey` (the mission's number and, from a Flight record, the spec's hash). A `Takeover` carries the world at T (the next tick to step, `World::tick`; none in the lobby), the newest part of each kind, each seat's last input and last command applied, the Handover's tick and the replay's cost. *Agent decisions:* a warm copy more than 2 seconds (240 ticks) behind is catching up and reported cold, and falls only if it loses 2 seconds more: it keeps its own checkpoint as a cold base, so it stays ready, and asks for a checkpoint, which it restores at once and steps to within 60 ticks of the end to be warm again; a Check that differs drops the copy and the standby is building (not ready) until a checkpoint, since anything this machine stepped would differ the same way; a Check's tick is the world's `tick()` when hashed, the tick the next step runs, as a checkpoint's tick is (K3 hashes when `tick()` is a multiple of 600); appointed in flight, the host sends Appoint and a checkpoint, no Flight record, and the checkpoint's identity checks the standby's build of the Appoint's mission; an Appoint starts everything afresh, the parts included (the host sends every part after one), and Ended keeps the parts; a record that cannot be read, or a gap in the journal, puts the standby behind (state 3) until an Appoint or a Flight, since every later seat input codes against the ones before; an unreadable chunk only spoils its checkpoint; chunks are exactly 4,096 bytes but the last, in any order, each once, at most 16 MB in all; a standby holds at most 100 seconds (12,000 ticks) of journal past its base, then drops its copy and base and asks for a checkpoint. Tests: `standby/tests.rs` (the crowd fight's records through their messages: a warm standby equal at every Check for a minute, and for 5 minutes ignored for the full run; a cold one replayed from ten moments; a damaged chunk; starvation; a mismatch; an appointment in flight; another mission, a gap and an unreadable record; the lobby and Dismiss; the thread's takeover and clean stops), about 7 seconds |
| K5 Rejoin tokens and reservations | Sonnet | K0 | `host/rejoin.rs`, new `host/rejoin_state.rs`, new `host/rejoin_tests.rs`, `client/rejoin.rs`, new `client/rejoin_tests.rs`, the client's token store trait, `tore-bot`'s `--token-file`, the `net-server-rejoin` scenario | Tokens drawn, sent, kept, expired and voided; the gate admitting a token holder; a rejoin restoring the player; reservations on a drop and not on End Mission; the reserved slot in the lobby state; Release; a plane lost while away; the end clearing them; all of it on a dedicated server too | Simulator: a dropped bot rejoins its reserved plane, which nobody else could take meanwhile; End Mission frees it, and so does Release; a plane lost while away gives the revival prompt, or the watch under `none`; a token 24 hours after its player left (the session's clock), from another session, or after a kick is refused in words; a full game admits the token holder; scores and lives follow the token. `net-server-rejoin`: a `tore-server`, a bot killed in flight and started again with its token file is back in its plane | **Built (K5, 2026-10-05):** no wire change; the wire is K0's, protocol 13. See [as built](#rejoin-tokens-and-reservations-as-built-k5) below the design. Files: `host/rejoin.rs` (tokens, the one reservation table, rejoin, Release, the gate's token list), new `host/rejoin_state.rs` (the *rejoin* part's coders), new `host/rejoin_tests.rs`, `client/rejoin.rs` (the kept token, `TokenStore`, `FileStore`, the Rejoin), new `client/rejoin_tests.rs`, `tore-bot --token-file`, the net lane's `net-server-rejoin`; and, beyond the row, `host/away.rs` (F2-A's table folded into K5's), `host/revive.rs` (revival from a plane nobody holds), a line each in `host/mod.rs` and `host/score.rs`, two lobby log events, `client/mod.rs`'s config token and kept token, and in `tore-world` the command `ReviveLost` (`world/revive.rs`, `commands.rs`, `commands_checkpoint.rs`). Tests: `host/rejoin_tests.rs` (14 on the simulator, the row's acceptance), `rejoin_state.rs` (the part round-trips and refuses damage), `client/rejoin_tests.rs` (3 real clients against the real host), `tore-world`'s `revive_lost_tests.rs` (5), the net lane's `net-server-rejoin` and its driver's Python test |
| K6 Candidates and host selection | Opus | K0 | `host/succession.rs`, new `host/succession_state.rs`, new `host/succession_tests.rs`, `client/candidate.rs`, new `client/candidate_tests.rs`, new `tore-net/src/peers.rs` and its `pub mod` line | Candidate reports and the CPU measure; the peers router and its reach answerer; reach tests and reports; the upload test; eligibility, ranking and the succession; setting 21 and its fallback; the King's warnings; the lobby's move decision, carried out by K4's handover (a one-line call once K4 is in) | Ranking by each measure in turn; a relayed player never chosen and never pinnable; reach tests along every row of the [punching table](#hole-punching) on the NAT simulator (the eligible rows are the punching rows); an upload test on a link throttled to half the need fails and at the full need passes; the warnings' words; the pin and its fallback; the bytes of a 30-player reach test bounded **Built (K6, 2026-10-05):** no wire change. `tore_net::peers::Peers`, the router in front of a joined socket: a Reach for its session answered as a player (10 a second from one address, 200 in all), a Reach answer timed, what only a host takes (Connect requests, Challenge answers, Discover, Keepalive) dropped until the game hosts (`set_hosting`, after which all goes to the host's transport but the old host's datagrams); `open` (a candidate's five Reaches 200 ms apart to each player address) and `test` (a player's five to each candidate address, the answering address with the most answers and its median a second after the last). A candidate's own Reach teaches a running test the port its router gave it, so a symmetric candidate is reached as a race reaches a symmetric host. `tore_session::client::candidate`: `Client::set_candidate` (`CandidateSettings`: the switch, the joined socket's candidates, the mapping type, `measure_cpu`, off by default so rigs and bots step nothing), the report sent once the lobby arrives and on every change, `measure_cpu` on a thread of its own, `Client::drive_peers` (the game's one call that hands reach work to its router and sends the Reach report), and the upload burst in whole 1,100-byte Filler packets. `host/succession.rs`: reports and measures by join order; reach tests for the three best candidates (by upload, router, CPU, join order) when a player joins or a report changes, at most one every 10 seconds, a player silent for 4 seconds reaching nobody; upload tests in the lobby, one at a time, 1 second at `upload_need` (28 KB/s an other player, 10 KB/s a standby, up to two), a pass at 90 percent; eligibility, `ranked_candidates`, `standby_choice` (for K3), `succession_message` and `send_succession` (for K3), `host_move` (for K4's handover, the one-line call), the pin's checks and fallback, the King's warnings; the *candidates* part in `host/succession_state.rs` (`CandidatesPart`, `Host::candidates_part`, `restore_candidates`), journaled with K1's parts (`state::JOURNALED`, coded and restored by `encode_part` and `restore_part`, players in join order; the journal's crowd fight restores it to the same bytes). Beyond the row's files, each a line or two (approved by the lead): the `update` hook in `host/mod.rs`, the pin's check in `king.rs`, the registry's gate removed from `settings.rs` (and its test), the client's field, update hook, `pub mod candidate` and Filler section kind in `client/mod.rs`, and two refusals dropped from `migration_seams_tests.rs`. *Agent decisions:* the house cannot test its own upload in the lobby without a wire change, so it passes until its flights say otherwise (the median direct player's share of its packets acknowledged, a sample a second, the last ten); the house is neither tested nor counted as a tester, and relayed players' reach does not count; Reach peers carries every candidate a player reported beside its seen address (not only its Local one), or a candidate's firewall would never open to a player's IPv6 address; a candidate's upload counts only when tested for at least the players now connected, and is tested again when more join; an unmeasured CPU passes; the threshold is fitted (`CPU_BUSY_PER_MILLE` 850, a measure up to 4.9 ms a tick passes, [baseline](baselines/host-selection-2026-10-05.md)); "No other game can take over" is said only once every other game has reported and the reach test is done; a pin that does not change the setting is never refused; the King's words for a pinned host, a CPU failure, a pin of nobody, a switched-off player, a dedicated server and the fallback are agent wording (`succession::words`). Tests: `tore-net`'s `peers_tests.rs` (routing, the answerer and its limit, every row of the punching table), `host/succession_tests.rs` (reports and reach on the simulator with each game's router, ranking by each measure in turn, a relayed player, the pin and its fallback, refusals, a dedicated server, the warnings' words, the calculated move, an upload test at half and at the full need, the candidates part, the succession, the punching table end to end, a 30-player test's bytes; and the ignored real-data CPU fit), `client/candidate_tests.rs` (the report, the CPU measure, the burst's pacing) **Built (KP, 2026-10-06):** no wire change; protocol 14. *The upload need follows the measured streams* (`succession::upload_need`, `standby_need`): 28 KB/s for each other player and, for each standby (up to two), a warm one 3,000 B/s and 520 B/s for each human flying, a cold one that and 80,000 B/s of checkpoints, from [K3's and KP's measurements](baselines/standby-stream-2026-10-05.md) (the fit and its table are in the [baseline](baselines/host-selection-2026-10-05.md#the-upload-need-follows-the-standby-streams-slice-kp)); `NEED_PER_STANDBY` is gone. *Agent decisions:* a candidate's cold standbys are the other direct players that may host and are of another platform or processor, at most two (the worst case, since which stand by is only known when the game moves; `cold_standbys_for`), and the cold figure is one number, the real-data average on the wire, whatever the mission's size. *The Reach answer limit:* the peers router answers 10 a second from one address and port, 160 from one IP address (`REACH_PER_IP`) and 200 in all, so 8 players behind one router, each testing a candidate, all reach it (the simulator test fails under the old 10 a second per IP address); the hosting transport's answerer (`tore-net/src/server.rs`) keeps the same three limits through one shared `ReachLimiter`, with the same 7-behind-one-NAT test against a hosting candidate (added at the lead's request). *The lobby's move:* `Host::carry_out_move` (`succession.rs`) makes the player to move to standby 1 (`make_first_standby` in `standby.rs`: standby 2 and standby 1 change places, each appointed again, or a game standing by for nobody replaces standby 1; only in the lobby, only a player that may stand by), and once it is ready calls `Host::hand_over` after the King's line (`words::moved`); the decision is made again every update and nothing moves while the standbys are off, the player is not ready, or the game has been handed over. The game that runs the host must act on `ResumeNote::HandedOver` as for a host that leaves (slices K7a and K9). Tests: `host/succession_tests.rs` (the need's figures against the measured streams, the cold count, a lobby moving to the better host when the house fails and another passes, with standby 2 and standby 1 changing places, a pin of a player standing by for nobody, nothing moving without ready standbys or while the house passes; the throttled-link upload test at the new need), `peers_tests.rs` (the per-IP cap and the LAN party of 8 on the simulator) |
| K8 Listing and relay follow the host | Opus | K0 | `crates/tore-master/src/{relay,master}.rs`, new `crates/tore-master/tests/migrate.rs`, `tore-net/src/master/{rendezvous,relay,join,routed}.rs` | The master moves a listing's relay channels with it; `HostListing` exports its listing part (master, id, token, channels) and resumes from one; a relayed player's game keeps its channel when its host is lost and connects on it again | On the simulator with the real master: a listed host with a relayed and a punched player hands its listing part to another game, which heartbeats from its own port; the listing keeps its id and shows the new address in the next browse; the relayed player's new handshake over its old channel reaches the new host; the old address gets nothing more; the once-a-minute rule still holds **Built (K8, 2026-10-05):** no wire change; the master protocol stays at version 1. `tore-master`: `Relays::move_host` moves every channel of a listing that moves, open or still opening, to the new address with its number and key (a `relay moved` log line, the `moved` count), and a Relay request names the listing's address of the moment as its host end. `tore_net::master::rendezvous`: the *listing* part is `ListingPart` (the master's name and address, the listing's id and token, the two intervals, each channel with its key and master address), coded by `ListingPart::encode` and `decode` (a plain byte coding of its own, 84 bytes with two channels, strict); `Rendezvous::listing_part` and `HostListing::part` export it, `part_version` changes whenever it may have, `Rendezvous::resume` and `HostListing::resume` carry a listing on from one (never registering: a Heartbeat with the token at once, the channels open from the start, Registering until the master's acknowledgement, then a `Listed` event), and `release` lets one go without a word (no Unregister, no Relay close, nothing queued sent) for an old host that learns another hosts now. `Joiner::relay_target` is the kept channel as a join's target. *Agent decisions:* a resumed listing's move is asked again every 3 seconds and counts the master as silent only after a listing's 90-second expiry, since the master drops a second move within the minute unanswered, so a second migration within the minute is listed at its new host within 3 seconds of the minute's end; the resumed listing looks up the part's master by name, whatever the new host's own options say. *Known limit:* a Meet still being repeated for an introduction made just before a move (at most two, 250 ms apart) goes to the old address. Tests: `tore-master`'s `tests/migrate.rs` (the row's acceptance on the simulator with the real master, and a second migration within the minute that moves once the minute is up), a unit test in `relay.rs` (a channel still opening follows its listing), and `tore-net`'s `master/listing_part_tests.rs` (the part's bytes, strict and fuzzed; a resumed listing; an unacknowledged move; an Unknown listing after a move; a release) |
| K3 The host's standby stream | Opus | K1, K2 | `host/standby.rs`, new `host/standby_tests.rs` | Appoint and dismiss (by K6's ranking once it lands; until then the longest-connected eligible players), the records out with the snapshots, the parts after their tick, Checks every 600 ticks, cold checkpoints every 1,200, the pacing, status in, resync, a leaving standby replaced | Simulator: a host and three bots, one warm and one cold standby run in-process by K2's `Standby`, fly the crowd fight 5 minutes: the warm one matches every Check; the cold one's checkpoints arrive within their pace; a forced mismatch resyncs; a standby appointed in flight is ready within its checkpoint's pace; the stream's bytes a second recorded. Ignored, for the full run: the same on the real-data 15 against 15 mission, warm and cold **Built (K3, 2026-10-05):** protocol 14 for the seat inputs' coding (below), no other wire change. `host/standby.rs`: `Host::standby_update`, called at the end of every update, drains the journal into each standby's stream (its own `StreamWriter`): ticks wait for a snapshot interval of them and go as one Ticks record, and any other record sends the waiting ticks first; State, Flight and Ended go as they come, a Flight or an Ended dropping a checkpoint still going out. Appointing sends Appoint, a checkpoint of the world when flying (no Flight record), and every state part; the first appointment turns the journal on and the last standby gone turns it off. A Check goes to the warm standbys at the first update at or after each 600th tick, named by the world's `tick()` then; a cold standby gets a checkpoint 1,200 ticks after its last began, one still going out delaying the next. A checkpoint goes in 4 KB chunks at its bytes over 8 seconds, at least 32,000 B/s, at most 1 Mbit/s (125,000 B/s) over 1.2 for the transport's framing and resends less the rest of the stream's bytes in the last second, and at most four chunks unacknowledged. A status (message 47) is kept and acted on at the next update: a standby behind is dismissed and not appointed again until the next flight; one that needs a checkpoint gets one, at most once 2 seconds after the last went out; a warm one failing two checks is appointed again, cold. The lobby's standby mark is each standby's role. `Host::ready_standbys` is what K6's Succession sends; `Host::standby_figures` gives each standby's role, status, checks and stream bytes (`StandbyFigures`, `StreamBytes`) for the log printers of K7a and K9. *Agent decisions:* a host appoints no standby until its caller switches them on (`Host::set_standbys_enabled`, for K7a and K9), since a game that runs no standby would keep the stream unread; the standbys are K6's best candidates (`ranked_candidates`), warm when their Candidate report's class is the host's; an appointed standby stays while K6's eligibility holds but for reach tests not yet made (`may_stay_standby`, beside K6's rules in `succession.rs`), so a player joining does not dismiss the standbys before the next reach test; whenever the standbys or their readiness change the ready ones go to K6's `send_succession`; a remaining standby keeps its role when the other leaves (appointing it again would cost it a checkpoint and leave it not ready) and a newcomer takes the free role; in flight a packet carries 256 bytes of messages, so the stream asks the transport for packets of messages alone, one for each fragment it queued (at most 16 an update), else a furball's checkpoint would not keep its pace; "unacknowledged" chunks are read from the transport's count of queued fragments; John's 1 Mbit/s is held for the whole stream to a standby, chunks giving way to the journal; a status from a game that is not a standby is ignored. Beyond the row's files, each a line or a few: `host/mod.rs` (the call at the end of `update`, the lobby's mark, the `pub use`), K0's `client/migration_seams_tests.rs` (a Standby status is no longer refused), K6's `succession.rs` (`may_stay_standby`, `candidate_of` visible to the stream) and the selection rule `host/standby*`. *Measured* (on the simulator, 40 ms round trip; [baseline](baselines/standby-stream-2026-10-05.md), before and after): under protocol 13 the journal cost 13 to 23 bytes a seat a tick, 53 KB/s to a warm standby with 30 humans, over the [journal's estimate](#the-journal-one-door-into-the-world) of 2 to 5 bytes and [host selection](#host-selection)'s 10 KB/s a standby from about five humans. *Built, protocol 14* (the lead's go-ahead): a seat's controls as the Inputs section codes them (the wire's quantized frame against the seat's last, behind a bit saying every control lies on the grid, each control by the trait otherwise, so the stream stays exact), its two command lists behind one presence bit, its view as Inputs codes it (offset and delay, one bit when unchanged, whole when it does not fit) and the command number applied as one bit when unchanged. Measured after: 4.1 to 5.6 bytes a seat a tick with three humans (1.5 KB/s to a warm standby, 7.2 KB/s to a cold one with its checkpoints), 3.4 with thirty (12.8 KB/s warm, 29 KB/s cold), 4.8 on the real 15 against 15 with four (2.3 KB/s warm; 64 KB/s cold, nearly all checkpoints of 0.52 to 1.1 MB each taking 8.0 to 10.9 seconds, the busiest second on the wire 126 KB/s with a few KB of snapshot differences in it); every Check equal. Thirty humans still pass K6's 10 KB/s a warm standby by about 28 percent, and a cold standby needs its checkpoints' pace, up to 1 Mbit/s. *Follow-up, not built:* the players part goes whole (about 1.7 KB with 30 players) each time any player's state changes, 0.3 to 3.3 KB/s with 30 humans; coding it per player against the last would cut that. Tests: `host/standby_tests.rs`, on the simulator with two of the bots' games standing by in process with K2's `Standby`: the crowd fight for 30 seconds with a warm and a cold standby (marks, every Check equal, each cold checkpoint within its pace, both holding the host's world, the bytes printed), a forced mismatch resynced, two failed checks going cold, standbys appointed in flight ready within their checkpoint's pace and dismissed when switched off, a leaving standby replaced and one behind dismissed for the flight, a dedicated server and a relayed player standing by for nobody; about 15 s. Ignored for the full run: the crowd fight for five minutes, thirty humans measured, the real-data 15 against 15 for five minutes (`TORE_DATA_DIR`, release), all printing the stream's bytes over the flight. Protocol 14's coding is tested in `journal_tests.rs`: a steady seat under 2 bytes, a weave on the grid under 5, and every way a seat input is coded (off the grid, each view's form, commands) read back to the bit **Built (KP, 2026-10-06):** `FRAMING` 1.25 (the transport's framing and resends over the chunks), so the pace's ceiling is 100,000 B/s of chunks against the 125,000 B/s line, since the cold stream's busiest second measured 126 KB/s with 1.2; the real-data run again at the new value (the cold stream alone 100 KB/s on average and 115.5 KB/s at most while a checkpoint goes out, under the line; the raw busiest second of 128 KB/s in the five-minute run carries the two players' differing snapshots; see [the baseline](baselines/standby-stream-2026-10-05.md#kp-the-framing-margin-re-measured)). `make_first_standby` (the lobby's move) is the second addition, described under K6 |
| K4 Takeover and resume | Opus | K3, K5 | `host/resume.rs`, new `host/resume_tests.rs`, new `standby/takeover.rs`, `client/migrate.rs`, new `client/migrate_tests.rs` | Detection, the standbys' order, `Host::resume`, absent players, the resume window, the fast-forward, Resume, Resumed and Backlog, the client's continuity, Taken over and the old host's return, the handover and Host moving | **The plan's simulator acceptance:** a host cut off from every link in a dogfight keeps running privately; the new host's world at T codes to the old host's bytes at T; every client gets snapshots again within 5 simulated seconds of the cut; missiles in flight at the cut fly on and end on the new host; kills from before the cut are in the debrief and Results. Also: a handover under 1 second; standby 2 takes over when standby 1 is cut too; an old host that comes back stops and resumes as a player; on one class, no correction of any client's own plane at the resume; a player who never resumes is dropped at 5 seconds with its plane reserved **Built (K4, 2026-10-06):** no wire change; protocol 14. `Host::resume` (`host/resume.rs`) builds the new host from a standby's `Takeover`: `Host::new` with the session part's flight spec (for the manifest; agent decision), then the session, court, scores, revivals, rejoin and candidates parts restored on the old host's clock, the world at T and an event tracker built from it, every player of the players part **absent** under a placeholder connection id at the top of the id range (agent decision: kept outside the connection table; a resume renames the placeholder by coding the revivals part again by join order), its own player (`Resumption::house`, a lobby id) the house and the old house a player like any other, but a house that handed over is dropped at once as having left. A game with an absent player's token becomes that player at the handshake (`resume_connected`, before `connected`; the link's house is exempt from silence as before). Resume is answered Resumed with a new flight (the client's plus one), the seat, plane, T, the last command the old host applied (the standby's last recorded input) and the plane's exact state as T begins, computed from the cockpit and `OwnshipTerms::of` the ownship at the combat tick (the step's own terms are not kept; agent decision); anyone else gets flight 0, and the Mission when its own differs. The clock holds at T until every absent seated player has resumed with its Backlog, at most 1.5 s (`RESUME_WINDOW`); then the host steps to the present at most 120 ticks an update (`FAST_FORWARD_TICKS`, agent decision) with no snapshot, each resumed seat on its kept inputs fed to its buffer a tick at a time (agent decision: a backlog seconds long would otherwise be dropped as too far ahead, its commands applied early), each absent seat on its last recorded controls and then neutral by the stall rule. The present is `Present`, the old host's next tick at a moment of the new host's clock, which the standby's client estimates from its newest snapshot's arrival plus half a round trip (`Client::present`); going live sets the flying clock to that pace (an origin a fraction of a tick back and the ticks run counted relative to it, agent decision, so a fresh hosting clock needs no negative origin). Players still absent 5 s after the takeover (`DROP_AFTER`) are dropped as silent players are: token clock, plane kept (slice K5), crown passed. `standby::takeover` holds the rule (`due`: standby 1 at 1.5 s of silence or on the Handover record, standby 2 three seconds later unless its race found a new host, never one not ready) and `take_over`/`take_over_thread`. The old host: Taken over is kept for `Host::moved_to` only from a standby naming itself; `Host::lost_everyone` (every remote player silent 1.5 s while it had a ready standby), `standby_addresses`, `reach_packet` and `hosting_answer` let its game ask standby 1 whether it hosts now, and `Host::step_down` stops it without a word (agent decision: the game remembers standby 1's addresses when it first asks, since the old host's own standbys time out). `Host::hand_over` ends the house's flight (debrief, one more tick takes the plane back), sends standby 1 the waiting ticks and Handover (`standby_handover` in K3's `standby.rs`) and every player Host moving, then steps no more; `handed_over` says when its records are through, and the house's connection ending no longer ends the game. The client (`client/migrate.rs`): the Succession kept; 1.5 s of silence (`DETECT_SILENCE`) or a Host moving races every address of every standby but its own from the same socket with its token (a relayed game its relayed address); the old host answering first stops a race the silence started; an Accepted with another session's id drops that address; 15 s with no new host gives the session up with "No other game could take over. The host left the game." (`GIVE_UP`). It keeps 10 s of predicted ticks (controls and view) beside the predictor's 2 seconds; on Resumed it starts a fresh wire, replays the kept ticks from T over the host's state with the commands numbered above the applied one (each at its tick, or T if earlier), and keeps its prediction when the replay equals it, else takes the replay as a correction; then Backlog, the commands renumbered from 1. `Client::host_here` (a game that took over: Taken over on the old connection, kept 2 s for it, then the race to the link), `Client::move_to` (an old host's game, racing the address that answered), `takeover_due`, `old_host` (for the peers router), `migration`, `migration_counts` (telemetry: resumed, failed, corrected). Words: `migrate::words` ("Lost contact with the host. Moving the game to Hawk...", "The game moved to Hawk."), as Notices, and `migrate` lines in the net log; the host's takeover, resume, live, drop, taken-over, handover and step-down notes from `Host::take_resume_notes` for the printers of K7a and K9. Beyond the row's files, each a few lines: the hooks in `host/mod.rs` (connected, inputs, the tick's feed and absent inputs, the update's clock, the snapshots, the house's leaving after a handover, the re-exports) and `client/mod.rs` (receive, update, poll_transmit and transmit, the closed event, `pub mod migrate`), `state.rs`'s `session_spec`, `standby.rs`'s `standby_handover`, `standby/mod.rs`'s `pub mod takeover`, K0's `migration_seams_tests.rs` (Resume, Backlog and Taken over are no longer "Not available yet.") and the battery selection's rules. *Measured* on the simulator (40 ms round trip, a warm standby): taken over 1.51 s after the cut, T one tick before the cut, the new host's world at T the old host's to the byte; snapshots again 3.0 to 3.05 s after the cut (the window waits its full 1.5 s for the old host's own player, lost with it); no client's plane corrected at the resume; a handover taken over in 21 ms, snapshots again within 215 ms; standby 2 at 4.52 s; a cold standby at the same world, snapshots again within 3.05 s. Tests: `host/resume_tests.rs` (the dogfight cut with a missile in flight and a kill booked, the world at T, every client back within 5 s, the missile ending on the new host, the kills in the Results, the old host flying on privately, its own player dropped at 5 s with its plane kept; a handover; standby 2; an old host that comes back, steps down and rejoins its reserved plane; a cold standby; a lobby moved; about 15 s in all), `client/migrate_tests.rs` (no standby to race, another session's host and the give-up, the old host answering again) and `standby/takeover.rs`'s rule. *Known limits:* a revival held or waiting for an absent player is not kept for it while it is absent (`revive.rs` treats a connection it cannot find as gone); the absent players are missing from the lobby and the roster's callsigns until they resume; the Mission goes again to a player who rejoins after the drop (the join's own) even when its game holds it. *Follow-ups noted, not built (their files are not this slice's):* K6's per-standby upload need (10 KB/s against the 12.8 KB/s measured at 30 humans), K6's Reach answer limit per IP (players behind one public IP may never be eligible), K3's FRAMING margin (1.2 to 1.25), and K6's lobby move, which is now one call to `Host::hand_over` in `succession.rs`. *KP (2026-10-06) built the follow-ups on K6's side and K3's `FRAMING`; K6's lobby move is now one call to `Host::hand_over`, see the K6 row.* |
| K7a Standby and takeover in the game | Opus | K4, K8 | `tore-app/src/net/{session,hosting}.rs`, new `net/standby.rs`, new `net/standby_tests.rs` | The joined socket on the game port; the peers router in the transport; the standby thread; the takeover (the socket into `HostThread::take_over`, the client onto the link, the keepalive thread stopped, the listing resumed); the house's leaving hands over; the old host's stop and resume; telemetry's counts | Real time on loopback: a hosting game, a joined game (a warm standby) and a bot; the host thread stopped abruptly: the joined game hosts, and the bot and the joined game's own player fly on within 5 seconds; a hosting game that leaves hands over; quick guard **Built (K7a, 2026-10-06):** no wire change; protocol 14. Every choice here is an agent decision unless the design or John's decisions say it. **The joined socket.** `Join::to` binds a dual-stack `ServerSocket` on the default game port, 26900, when it is free and on any port otherwise (`Join::to_from` names the port; `Transport::Joined`); the remembered host port is not used, since a join by address reads no settings. **The peers router.** Every joined socket (by address, through the master, and the tests' plain sockets) is read through the session's `Peers` (`ThroughPeers`), and after each update `Client::drive_peers`, the router's update and its sends run. The client is told its candidates once for each socket: the switch, `host_candidates` toward the host's address (Local IPv4, Global IPv6) on the socket's port, the joiner's mapping type, and the CPU measure, on whenever the game may host. A game may host when the player's switch is on (`NetSession::set_may_host`, on by default; its Options screen is K7b's), its socket can host (a joined `ServerSocket`) and it is not relayed. **The standby** (`net/standby.rs`): `GameStandby` runs K2's `StandbyThread` once the lobby arrives; it builds the spec the client last built (the lobby's mission, then the flight with its loadouts, shared from the session's mission builder), refused when a Flight record's FNV-1a 64 of the spec text differs; each pump hands it the client's records and, while appointed, sends its status every 500 ms; its notes go to the game's log and as `standby` lines to the net log. **The takeover.** When `Client::takeover_due` says so, the socket leaves the transport (a join through the master drops its joiner, which holds no channel since a relayed game never hosts) for `HostThread::take_over` (`TakeoverSetup`): the new thread builds the host from the standby with `take_over_thread` off the frame loop, on the session's own clock (`RealClock` is copied, so the client's `Client::present` and the host's clock agree), turns its standbys on, carries on the old host's listing from the listing part (`HostListing::resume`), asks the router for the port as hosting does, and reports `Report::TookOver { tick }`, on which the client calls `host_here` with the link. The game's transport becomes `Transport::Hosted`: the link to its own host, a second handle on the socket for the old host, and the `Side`, where the thread's own `Peers` (hosting, with the client's `old_host` passed on every pump) puts the old host's datagrams. The keepalive thread stops. A takeover that cannot build its host ends the thread with `End::TakeoverFailed` and hands the socket back; the client races on. **The listing part** (beyond the row, approved by the lead): `Host::set_listing_part` takes the listing's `ListingPart` coded whenever its `part_version` changes, the journal sends it as the eighth part (empty when not listed), and `Host::resume` restores it for `Host::listing_part`. **The house leaving** (`Command::Stop`, which dropping the session sends) hands over with `Host::hand_over` when a ready standby exists, and the thread ends without a word once `handed_over` (or after `STOP_GRACE`), the listing released without an Unregister (`End::HandedOver`); with none the game ends as before. **A lobby move** (KP's calculated host, by `hand_over` with no stop) ends the thread the same way once handed over, but hands the socket back (`End::MovedOn` with standby 1's last known addresses) and the game's client races them as a player. **The old host.** When `lost_everyone` or `moved_to` says so, the thread asks standby 1 at the addresses it had then, every second (`ASK_EVERY`), with `reach_packet`; the game port takes the answer (`hosting_answer`) before the host sees it, the host steps down, and the thread ends with `End::SteppedDown(address)`, the socket handed back (`HostThread::take_socket`); the game's transport becomes the joined socket again behind a new router, and `Client::move_to` resumes with the new host. Sends to the link's address over a socket are dropped, so the old house's client does not error while it still names the link. **Addresses.** The thread's game port (`GamePort`) and a joined socket name an IPv4 peer that arrives on a dual-stack socket at its plain address (`canonical`), so the router's and the client's old-host comparisons hold. **Logs and telemetry.** The host's `take_resume_notes` and its standbys (when a role, warm or ready changes, looked at every 250 ms) are `Report::Migration` lines, in the game's log (`Host:`) and the net log (`host`); the client's own `migrate` lines are K4's. `ThroughFacts` carries `Client::migration_counts` (resumed, failed) to the Internet Lobby's Report (two lines in `internet_screen/app.rs`). The takeover's settings are a hosted game's (`hosting::takeover_config`): the name, password and every King's setting come from the session part, the open planes take the defaults. **Found and fixed (K4, `host/mod.rs` and `host/resume.rs`):** a game a player hosts has no empty timeout, so a mission taken over ended before its players resumed; seated players still expected back now keep it from being empty (`Host::seated_absent`). *Measured* on loopback (debug build, synthetic import, warm standby): the host thread vanishing in flight, snapshots again 3.1 s after the loss for the joined game's player and the bot (the window waits its whole 1.5 s for the lost house); a hosting game leaving, the joined game hosting 50 ms later, snapshots again within 0.36 s; a host cut off for 4 s, the others back within 3.2 s and the old host's own player resumed with the new host 4.6 s after the cut. Tests: `net/standby_tests.rs` (the three, real time on loopback with three whole sessions, about 13 s, and the lines' words), `host/listing_part_tests.rs` (the part through the journal, a standby and a takeover). Beyond the row's files, each a line or a few: `net/mod.rs`, `internet_screen/app.rs`, tore-session's `host/{mod,state,resume}.rs` and `journal_tests.rs`, the selection rules. *Known limits:* `Host::resume` drops a house that handed over as having left, which for a lobby move (its player stays) makes the old house rejoin by its token; End Mission in a game that took over ends the mission for everyone, as for any hosting game; a join on a plain one-family socket (tests only) never hosts. |

An old host that loses every player asks standby 1 with Reach and steps down on the answer (`move_to`); a hosting bot whose time is up hands the game over to a ready standby and exits when `handed_over()` is true, or says the host left when none is ready; a handover the host makes itself (the lobby move of slice KP) stops the host and the bot goes on as a player. The code is `src/bin/tore-bot.rs` and a module beside it, `src/bin/tore-bot/hosting.rs`. Lines: `NAME: host: ...` (the host's log, resume notes, once a second the world's tick, guided missiles in flight and aircraft kills, every 5 seconds each standby's role, state and checks), `NAME: standby: ...` (a standby's notes), `NAME: migrate: ...` (lost the host, taking the game over, snapshots again N ms after the loss was noticed, the counts), `NAME: listing: ...`. *Agent decisions:* one thread for the host and the bot's client (the loop wakes at least every 2 ms), where the game gives the host a thread; a bot that took the game over leaves only after its guests, at most 25 seconds past its `--seconds`, so a scenario's bots end in order; `--standby` defaults to on for a host and off for a player. Scenarios, in the net lane (`tools/battery_scenarios/net.py`, each from one build of the four programs): `net-migrate-kill` (SIGKILL in the fight once a kill is booked, a guided missile in flight when one flew in time), `net-migrate-handover`, `net-migrate-relay` (a master on loopback, two direct pilots and a relayed bot: the new host resumes the listing, the master logs `relay moved ... channels=1`, the relayed bot keeps its channel) and `net-reach-upload` (host selection on loopback: the bot that may host is appointed warm first standby with equal checks, the one that may not never is). *Measured* (debug build, 4 players on the guide's mission, a machine loaded by other builds): the first standby took the game over at the loss, every player had resumed within 0.35 s, the host was live 2.1 s after the takeover (the 1.5 s resume window waits for the old host's own player, lost with it, then 435 ticks of fast-forward) and every pilot's snapshots came again 2.0 to 2.3 s after the loss was noticed (3.5 to 3.8 s after the host's last packet); a handover is taken over with snapshots again within 0.9 s. The fast-forward costs real time, 0.8 to 4.7 ms a tick here, so a debug build on a busy machine can miss the plan's 5 seconds (one run took 6.0 s after the loss was noticed with the fast-forward at 4.7 ms a tick): the scenario asserts 3.5 seconds after the loss was noticed (the plan's 5, less the 1.5 seconds of silence), scaled by `--timeout-scale`, and when the new host's fast-forward costs more than 2 ms a tick it asks instead that every pilot's snapshots follow the host going live within 1.5 seconds. Which missiles end where, exactly, is `host::resume_tests`' to check on the simulator; the scenarios check that the new host's world carries on from the old host's last tick with at least its kills and that its Results hold them. *Known limits:* the lobby move of slice KP has no scenario yet (its `HandedOver` note is handled; a handover scenario that triggers a move needs KP merged); the brief's missile identity check is the simulator's; `net-migrate-relay` shows the move once, since the master moves a listing once a minute. Tests: the Python tests of the drivers' checks (`tools/test_battery_net.py`, `MigrationTests`), `tore-bot`'s option tests, and the four scenarios. |
| K7b Migration and rejoin on the screens | Sonnet | K7a, F2-L, J5 | `tore-app/src/net/play.rs`, new `net/rejoin_store.rs` (the token file), `lobby_screen/{settings_panel,players_panel}.rs`, the Rejoin marks in `direct_screen/` and `internet_screen/`, the Options switch | The HUD and Messages lines; the token file; the Host row (calculated or a player); Release; the reserved slot's words; the Rejoin marks; "Let my game take over hosting" | `facts` tests; headless renders of the Settings page with the Host row, a reserved slot and a Rejoin mark; a windowed run through `tools/agent-run.sh`: a hosting game killed while a joined game and a bot fly; the joined game hosts and shows the line **Built (K7b, 2026-10-06):** no wire change; protocol as K7a left it. Every choice here is an agent decision unless the design or John's decisions say it. **The token file** (`net/rejoin_store.rs`): `rejoin-v1.conf` in the data folder, one `token SESSION TOKEN LIFE LAST_SEEN ADDRESS CALLSIGN` line for each session (newest first, 32 at most, an expired one dropped whenever the file is read or written, a file that cannot be read read as empty); `GameStore` is the `TokenStore` every client of the game gets (`equip`, so a client the relay path starts again has it too), writing the token when the host grants it and again when the connection ends. A game this game hosts keeps its token with no address. **Sending it:** `Join::token` (the screens' own: the session's token from a found game, the master's details, or the typed address) else the token kept for the host's address goes in the Challenge answer (`ClientConfig::token`, so a full game admits it); a join by an address the token was not kept for sends a Rejoin once the host has accepted (`NetSession::rejoin_known`, once for each session), so a game found any way comes back as itself. The host's own words ("Welcome back, Viper: your aircraft is waiting.", or why a token does not work) reach Messages as notices. **The marks:** Direct Connection says *Rejoin* where the state is (Lobby or Flying) for a game whose session id, from the discovery answer, the game holds an unexpired token for (the line under the list says "You were in this game as Viper. Join takes you back; ..." and Join says "Rejoining '...'"); the Internet Lobby does the same once the master's details name the game's session, which they do for the selected game, so a listed game says Rejoin after it is selected (the Internet Lobby's list carries no session id otherwise; a game the player has not selected is joined without the token in the Challenge answer and rejoined by the Rejoin message, which a full game refuses). A game of another version never says it. **Options:** "Let my game take over hosting" in both Options panels, kept in `network-v1.conf` as `may-host no` when off (on by default, John, 2026-10-05) and read when a session starts (`NetSession::may_host`; it takes effect for the next game joined, not the running one); the Direct Connection panel's constructor now takes the remembered settings (a clippy limit). **The lines:** the client's "Lost contact with the host. Moving the game to Hawk..." and "The game moved to Hawk." were already notices (K4) and reach the HUD in flight and Messages in the lobby through the same `App::message`; the host's `ResumeNote`s that matter to a player ("Viper is back.", "Viper did not come back to the game. Viper can still rejoin with the rejoin token.") are `Report::Said` lines, notices in the new host's game (`standby::said_line`); the others stay in the log. **The lobby:** the Host row (the Game page's last: "Calculated (Maverick hosts)" or the pinned player's callsign; a click turns through calculated and every player who is not relayed, by lobby id; a pin made in flight says it applies when the lobby returns; the Game page's rows sit 19 pixels apart to make room); Release (the Players panel's third button, for a player who is away with its aircraft, and, for a plane kept for a player who dropped and is not in the Players list, the panel opens on the reserved slot selected in Slots, `Request::Release`, message 53); a plane kept for a dropped player reads "AI (Viper away)" with the lock mark, is dimmed and refused to anyone else ("Plane 2 is kept for Viper, who is away."); a game that stands by has the outlined house (`standby.svg`, a new icon in the atlas, `ui-text.bin` regenerated with the glyphs byte for byte as before) where the house has the solid one, and the selected player's line says "Stands by to host: first."; an away player's status reads "Away"; a game is told when it begins to stand by ("Your game stands by to host, first in line: ..."), and the players who are not the King are told of a pin ("The King pinned Goose as the host."). *Known limit, K10's:* after a lobby move `Host::resume` still drops the old house as having left, so its player comes back by its token instead of resuming (`host/resume.rs`, not in this slice's files); the token file means the game now has the token to do it. Tests: `net/rejoin_store.rs` (the file: round trip, the 32, expiry, damage), `net/rejoin_game_tests.rs` (a real `NetSession` on loopback keeps its granted token, is welcomed back by address and by session, and a new player is not), `lobby_screen/k7b_tests.rs` (the marks, the Host row, Release on a player and on a reserved slot, the lines), `direct_screen/rejoin_tests.rs` and `internet_screen/rejoin_tests.rs` (the mark, the selection line, the token on the join, the switch kept); snapshot states `direct-rejoin`, `internet-rejoin`, `lobby-host-row`, `lobby-standby`, `lobby-release` and `lobby-reserved` in the menus lane; and two windowed net scenarios in `tools/battery_scenarios/net_screens.py`: `net-window-rejoin` (a game killed in flight with SIGKILL and started again in the same data folder is welcomed back in its aircraft) and `net-window-migrate` (a hosting bot killed in flight, two bots standing by and the game flying with its switch off: the game's log and, in its pictures, the HUD carry "Lost contact with the host. Moving the game to Pilot1..." and "The game moved to Pilot1."; the game resumed 1.5 s after the takeover and snapshots came again 2.3 s after the loss was noticed). *Known limit, K10's:* the game that takes over says "Moving the game to Pilot2..." before it hosts, naming the other standby, since a client's race leaves out its own address (`client/migrate.rs`) |
| K10 Acceptance and measurement | lead, then John | all | `docs/baselines/migration-<date>.md` | The stream's bytes and the takeover's times on the real-data 15 against 15 mission, warm and cold; the lead's smoke test; then John on three machines: the hosting game killed in a fight, one player relayed if he can, one rejoin | The plan's acceptance for stage K: with real processes clients fly on within 5 seconds of the host's loss, missiles in flight continue, the debrief keeps the kills from before, and a dropped player rejoins its reserved aircraft |

**What runs at once.**

1. **K0** alone: it takes the wire and places every hook.
2. **K1, K2, K5, K6 and K8** together (four Opus, one Sonnet). Their files are
   disjoint: K1 is the only one to edit `host/mod.rs` beyond K0's hooks, K2
   owns the new `standby` module, K5 and K6 their own host and client modules
   (K6 also `tore-net`'s new `peers.rs`), K8 the master and `tore-net`'s master
   module.
3. **K3**, then **K4**, which needs K3's stream and K5's tokens.
4. **K7a** and **K9** together (the game; `tore-bot` and the lane), and K6's
   one-line lobby move once K4 is in.
5. **K7b**, then **K10**.

**Beside other work.** Slices F2-A (the idle aircraft) and F2-D (the debrief)
edit `host/away.rs`, `host/results.rs` and `host/mod.rs`; K1 changes every
`self.world` in `host/mod.rs`, so whichever lands second rebases on the other.
F2-A's reservation and K5's are one table: whichever lands second uses the
other's. Slice J5 owns `net/session.rs` and `net/play.rs` now, so K7a and K7b
follow it; K7b also follows F2-L's lobby panels. Stage L's content check is
untouched: a standby has passed the content check as a player already.

### Questions for John (stage K)

The design builds as written with these recommendations; each is John's to
change.

1. **Standbys:** up to two, the second a fallback if the first is lost too.
   *Recommended* (the plan's "one or two"; one halves the stream but leaves no
   fallback).
2. **Warm standbys:** a standby on the host's own system and processor type
   simulates the mission alongside the host, which costs it 15 to 40 percent
   of one core and makes the takeover immediate; any other standby is cold.
   *Recommended.* Without warm standbys every takeover replays up to 10
   seconds of mission, which in a furball passes the 5-second target.
3. **Cadence and pacing:** a cold standby gets a checkpoint every 10 seconds,
   paced at no more than 128 KB/s (1 Mbit/s); a warm one gets one when
   appointed or after a failed check, with a check every 5 seconds.
   *Recommended.*
4. **Checkpoint size levers first** (leaving out destroyed AI actors' sensor
   pictures, tighter flare coding): *not recommended now.* Pacing and warm
   standbys keep the stream within the budget; K10 measures it and the levers
   wait for a measured need.
5. **What a player sees:** HUD lines "Lost contact with the host. Moving the
   game to Hawk..." and "The game moved to Hawk."; the own aircraft flies on,
   the others hold still for 2 to 3 seconds and then jump. *Recommended.*
6. **Detection:** 1.5 seconds of silence before the game moves. Shorter moves
   sooner but risks moving on a Wi-Fi hiccup. *Recommended.*
7. **Randomness for tokens:** no `getrandom`; 128-bit tokens from the standard
   library's randomly keyed hasher, which the operating system's random
   source keys. *Recommended.*
8. **The calculated host in the lobby:** the game stays where it is while that
   machine passes the test for its players, and moves only when it does not
   and another passes. *Recommended* over always moving to the best scorer,
   which could move it whenever someone joins.
9. **Reservations:** a drop reserves the aircraft, ending one's flight (End
   Mission) does not; a reserved aircraft lost while its player is away
   brings the revival rules when the player returns (under co-op's default of
   no revival that is John's "observe until the round ends"). *Recommended.*
10. **A switch "Let my game take over hosting"** in Options, on by default,
    so a player on a weak connection can opt out. *Recommended.*
11. **Dedicated servers never migrate.** *Recommended:* a server is the host
    by its operator's choice.
