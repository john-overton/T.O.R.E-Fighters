# Initial architecture

The M0 environment supports the first M1a menu slice, partial M1b all-theater renderer and partial M1c Hornet free flight. M0's full title census, salvage inventory, parity specification, and AI VM decision remain open.

These are baseline-compatible versions, not automatically the latest versions. Exact versions live in `Cargo.lock`. See upstream [wgpu 27 documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu/27.0.1/wgpu/) and [winit 0.30 documentation](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.13/winit/) for API contracts.

The shell creates its window on the main event loop and uploads a 640 × 480 RGBA menu canvas to a Metal/native GPU texture. The shader draws a scaled, letterboxed image using linear filtering. The same viewport calculation maps physical mouse coordinates back into retail coordinates, including Retina scaling. It handles zero-sized windows and recoverable surface loss. Fatal graphics/startup errors return a failing process status.

`assets.rs` selectively decompresses resources into a versioned local pack and validates them before import completes. `menu.rs` composites original background, button pieces, and font strips and owns UI state. `renderer.rs` owns the surface, texture, and scaling. `audio.rs` mixes at most eight PCM effects plus an optional music loop, with linear resampling into the device rate. Audio initializes independently and can fail without blocking menus. No input device or microphone is opened.

The app and general extractor share the same EALIB/DCL readers. `Archive::open` reads a directory and seeks to selected resources; it does not load whole disc archives. The menu retains a 16 MiB resource cap; the general CLI has an explicit configurable cap for larger media. The Python entry point handles portable invocation and SHA-256 report enrichment; it contains no second decompressor.

Menu-only startup randomness chooses one of the five native backgrounds independently of future simulation state. The selected background's embedded palette colors shared sprites/fonts, and native bar offsets keep controls aligned. Hover/focus notifications do not enqueue audio.

Menu drawing uses CPU composition for this small static canvas; it is not a commitment to software-rendering flight scenes. The window sleeps while idle. Hover transitions and transient placeholder messages schedule temporary redraws. The fragment shader is authored source; it contains no retail bytes.

## Boundaries for menu work

Keep `tore-formats` independent of windowing and GPU APIs. The future simulation likewise needs to run headlessly with deterministic inputs. Avoid empty placeholder crates or premature engine abstractions.

Menu rendering should consume decoded palettes, indexed images, font data, and recovered layout geometry. Recover specifications from the TypeScript reference; implement runtime behavior in Rust. Do not introduce a web shell, copy the Three.js engine, or select a modern widget toolkit before checking retail geometry requirements.

Import user-owned media at runtime into platform application data. The v1 pack is a development cache of selected decompressed resources, not a stable mod/save format. `gameassets/` is a local source-media convenience, not a runtime bundle or save-data location. See [menu formats](formats/menu.md) for the current limits and provenance.

## First simulation renderer

`terrain.rs` constructs a world from the selected retail T2/MM, numbered texture family and its DAY2 variant palette. Its camera and surface queries have no GPU/window dependency. `sim_renderer.rs` uploads geometry and a texture array, owns depth targets and draws terrain plus a fullscreen sky pass; `terrain.wgsl` supplies the initial perspective, sampling and fog. `renderer.rs` composes this scene with the transparent CPU HUD, resizing depth and surface together. This separation allows aircraft/object/weather passes and a deterministic simulation to be added without coupling format readers to wgpu.

The initial implementation uses full-resolution fixed triangles and an authored sky/fog projection. It is not the native adaptive renderer. All geometry/colors come from local source data at runtime; no retail derivatives are embedded. See [theater findings](formats/theater.md) for recovered versus authored behavior. The Hornet adapter now advances at 120 fixed ticks/second; the developer free camera still uses elapsed wall time for inspection.

The creator selects among all 16 base theaters. Scene replacement rebuilds the GPU vertex/texture buffers for that world; a variable texture-array layer count also supplies the sky shader's layer index. Only the active world mesh is built, while the bounded source bundle remains cached. Maps and fonts stay in the menu compositor. Source text shading is preserved when tinting; ARMFont/SMLFONT replace the unsuitable BODYFONT in the investigation UI and notices.

The Hornet slice adds dependency resolution and bounded BRF/SH/FNT readers to `tore-formats`. `flight.rs` in the app contains fixed-tick state/integration without wgpu/winit dependencies; `aircraft.rs` adapts imported geometry and camera poses. `instruments.rs` renders independent small rasters from flight/equipment state. The GPU terrain pass now accepts an aircraft vertex stream and original rectangular atlas with shared depth; front/other instrument cameras render offscreen. CLI extraction and cache import share the same dependency resolver. These adapters do not execute imported x86 modules. See [aircraft evidence and open native parity](formats/aircraft.md).


`flight_ui.rs` owns desktop command dispatch, imported menu navigation, session presentation settings and pause state. `hud.rs` draws the forward-flight HUD from state and source font glyphs, projecting the ladder/path through the renderer's 60-degree camera convention. Simulation remains independent of both. The full-canvas cockpit is transparent art over the world; instrument windows are independent rasters. Menu/focus pauses stop fixed ticks and engine loops, and input transitions clear held controls. Shader zoom is shared by terrain and sky projection; camera previews restore the main camera before drawing.


`flight_canvas.rs` now composes the flight-only overlay at an aspect-responsive size (physical drawable, proportionally capped at 1920×1080). The source cockpit is uniformly cover-fit to that full area, and instrument layout rectangles anchor to actual edges. Native instrument rasters go directly to their destination sizes instead of passing through a reduced 640×480 composite. Static cockpit layers and unchanged scaled panel rasters are cached. Alpha-aware filtering prevents dark transparent borders. `renderer.rs` recreates its UI texture when dimensions change and uses the full viewport for flight; menus/viewer overlays retain their existing canvas. Pointer conversion uses the same responsive panel rectangles, while the centered pause menu retains menu coordinates. HUD metadata is 15% smaller, with projection compensation for both shrink and portrait aspect.
