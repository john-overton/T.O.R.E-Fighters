# Initial architecture

The M0 environment now supports the first M1a main-menu slice. M0's full title census, salvage inventory, parity specification, and AI VM decision remain open.

| Component | Choice | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Rust 2024, compiler 1.91.1 | Reproducible native builds |
| Workspace | `crates/tore-app` | Application entry point and desktop shell |
| Window/input | `winit` 0.30 | Native window lifecycle and input |
| Graphics | `wgpu` 27 | Metal on macOS; native backends for Windows/Linux |
| Startup bridge | `pollster` 0.4 | Wait for GPU initialization without a general async runtime |
| Audio device | `cpal` 0.16 | Native output for the small PCM mixer; [upstream API](https://docs.rs/cpal/0.16.0/cpal/) |
| Formats | Dependency-free `crates/tore-formats` | Bounded EALIB, raw-literal DCL, PIC/glyphs, and a narrow CHOOSEAC DLG reader |
| Checks | Cargo, Python standard library, GitHub Actions | Local and CI checks |

These are baseline-compatible versions, not automatically the latest versions. Exact versions live in `Cargo.lock`. See upstream [wgpu 27 documentation](https://docs.rs/wgpu/27.0.1/wgpu/) and [winit 0.30 documentation](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.13/winit/) for API contracts.

The shell creates its window on the main event loop and uploads a 640 × 480 RGBA menu canvas to a Metal/native GPU texture. The shader draws a scaled, letterboxed image using linear filtering. The same viewport calculation maps physical mouse coordinates back into retail coordinates, including Retina scaling. It handles zero-sized windows and recoverable surface loss. Fatal graphics/startup errors return a failing process status.

`assets.rs` selectively decompresses resources into a versioned local pack and validates them before import completes. `menu.rs` composites original background, button pieces, and font strips and owns UI state. `renderer.rs` owns the surface, texture, and scaling. `audio.rs` mixes at most eight PCM effects plus an optional music loop, with linear resampling into the device rate. Audio initializes independently and can fail without blocking menus. No input device or microphone is opened.

Menu drawing uses CPU composition for this small static canvas; it is not a commitment to software-rendering flight scenes. The window sleeps while idle. Hover transitions and transient placeholder messages schedule temporary redraws. The fragment shader is authored source; it contains no retail bytes.

## Boundaries for menu work

Keep `tore-formats` independent of windowing and GPU APIs. The future simulation likewise needs to run headlessly with deterministic inputs. Avoid empty placeholder crates or premature engine abstractions.

Menu rendering should consume decoded palettes, indexed images, font data, and recovered layout geometry. Recover specifications from the TypeScript reference; implement runtime behavior in Rust. Do not introduce a web shell, copy the Three.js engine, or select a modern widget toolkit before checking retail geometry requirements.

Import user-owned media at runtime into platform application data. The v1 pack is a development cache of selected decompressed resources, not a stable mod/save format. `gameassets/` is a local source-media convenience, not a runtime bundle or save-data location. See [menu formats](formats/menu.md) for the current limits and provenance.
